Short answer to your questions in order: yes, yes and yes. I moved on from Unconventional Gas in 2014 so substantial developments in regulations may be lost on me, FYI.

First question: Do regulations go far enough? I say yes for short, but there are exceptions. Let’s start with methods of contamination. High level there are really two ways: problem above or problem below. The good side of regulations are that oil majors go above and beyond regulation for multiple reasons but the top two are liability and competition. Majors can afford to abide above standard, sometimes lobbying in the same breath for tougher regulations to price Mom and Pop’s out of competition.  A positive result of this tactic is that PA regulation for drill pads is 3mL of fluid spilled is a recordable. PA State agencies are understaffed to enforce that level of control, so the majors tend to be the ones that have records. So when XTO’s lawyers say “Hey Joe Schmo drills more than us and has ZERO 3mL recordables when we know that company has runs millions of gallons of fluid through that site”.  There are other examples at surface, but take it from me this is a positive thing that could use more oversight. Negative is obviously competition is discouraged at the mid-sized level.

Regarding problem below. One of my specific job duties was to coordinate and validate well cement. Improper cement jobs can lead to an unstable well, even if the threat of contamination is low. In my 3 years, while we had up to 12 rigs active in PA, my company was tied to one env incident that was substantial and reported in the press. It was a big deal, but my professional opinion is my company did it’s due diligence prior to the event. And we remediated the incident arm-in-arm with State and Local Governments. Semi-related, the cement bond log NOT being run back in 2010 was a contributor to Deep Sea Horizon (“Macondo” in industry speak).

Second question: Is it ever 100% safe? No. There is always risk in drilling, and that risk increases with new science. I can say that we take land owners’ interest at heart first, then neighbors of land owners, then the town, then the State when it comes to environmental and PR concerns. When it comes to legal concerns, the prioritization reverses. That’s why oil lawyers are reputed sharks while oil PR is silver-tongued and always opening its wallet.

Third Question: Should we push for other protections? Always, but within reason. I’ll give an example from 2011-2014. Remember this may have changed. At the time a Vendor did not have to publicly disclose what was in Frack Sand. Frack Sand is a mixture of chemicals that often can be harmful if ingested. My company would not let Vendors pump frack fluid without us reviewing the formula, but would tie our hands when it came to public disclosure. I disagreed with this regulation. I’ll throw shade because it’s so far removed but Halliburton was the jerk in this argument. They didn’t want to publicly disclose their composition. We were forced to oblige. Coincidentally Halliburton was on a press tour at the time for developing a drinkable frack sand, ironically that formula never made it down our wells.

Anyway, that’s a first pass and thanks for asking.

Although Dr. Levine did say the tool is available on the site, I would bet she meant to say the _output_ from the tool is posted weekly. Access to the tool itself appears to be limited to government agencies. It was originally mentioned here in the 7th paragraph

https://www.pa.gov/guides/responding-to-covid-19/#PhasedReopening

and CMU described it in more detail here

https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2020/april/dashboard-will-help-inform-state-decision-makers.html

When you look at the screenshot from the tool, you can see that the user has many options to choose from when asking which industries are safe to open and where. Additionally, you can see other aspects of the analysis available but not displayed in the screenshots. The first version of the weekly report that Dr. Levine described today is available here, but I was unable to find a version from May 8th. I'll update if I can find it. The version from May 1st was the version that contributed to the decision to move 24 counties from red to yellow on May 8th, so I would have expected a May 8th version to be published for use this Friday. Googling the title only reveals the May 1st edition, linked right here

https://www.governor.pa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200501-CMU-Risk-Based-Decision-Support-Tool.pdf

So you can see a description and purpose of the tool, a sample screenshot of how it looks to the user, and the May 1st edition of the weekly report that was delivered to the governor. However, I have seen no indication that the tool itself is available on the website. I think it would be great if people could put their heads together and crowdsource something like the tool, but all hell broke loose this week and there may not be much of an appetite for it anymore.",1589238658,1,False,2qn7a,,,,0,,,,,,11-05-2020,16:10:58,,,1589238841.0,False,ghwz4p,1

WEST WHITELAND—For the second time in a little more than a year, a sinkhole has exposed a section of pipe in the Mariner East pipeline project.

A sinkhole, which measured 5 feet wide and 10 feet deep, developed Sunday in a neighborhood in the 400 block of Lisa Drive in West Whiteland, the same neighborhood where a previous sinkhole exposed the Mariner East 1 pipeline. The same line has been exposed in the latest incident, but both Chester County officials and Energy Transfer Partners said the pipeline was not damaged. ETP and Sunoco officials indicated Sunday they would shut down Mariner East 1 out of ""an abundance of caution.""

When sinkholes first developed in the neighborhood, in November 2017, state officials shut down construction on the pipeline.

Once again the exposed pipe is the older, smaller Mariner East 1 pipeline, which has been online for months carrying butane, propane and ethane from the Marcellus Shale region to a facility in Marcus Hook.

Chester County emergency services officials confirmed the sinkhole, but stressed the pipeline was no damaged and there was no impact on public safety.

“At no time during the incident was there any impact to public safety, no evacuations were ordered, and no injuries reported,"" said Bill Turner, Deputy Director for Emergency Management, Chester County Department of Emergency Services.

Turner said the incident has been closed, however, ""Sunoco and the PUC will continue to investigate,”

A spokesperson for Texas-based Energy Transfer partners, said the company was shutting down Mariner East 1 as a precautionary measure in the wake of the latest sinkhole incident.

""Late this afternoon we responded to a subsidence feature on Lisa Drive that exposed our 8-inch Mariner East 1 line,"" said ETP spokesperson Lisa Dillinger in an emailed statement. ""There is no impact to the line, but we have voluntarily shut it in out of an abundance of caution. We have geologists on site. It is too early to know additional details at this time. We are working with the PA PUC in the investigation, and will remain in communication with local officials and first responders.""

State regulators with the Public Utility Commission were on the site inspecting the situation Sunday afternoon.

Residents and public officials expressed a concern about the pipeline being exposed in the wake of plummeting temperatures.

Both state Sen. Andy Dinniman, D-19 of West Whiteland, and state Rep. Carol Comitta, D-156 of West Chester, issued statements asking that the entire Mariner East project be shut down while state officials review the situation.

""The entire Mariner East project should be shut down until a review independent of Sunoco and the PUC has been completed,"" Dinniman said in a lengthy statement. ""The PUC process itself is in dire need of re-examination and revamping. And we must pass strong pipeline safety legislation now. Currently there is no real, meaningful and effective pipeline regulatory process in the Commonwealth.""

""I urge the PUC to shut down the M1 pipeline by Emergency Order immediately and keep it down as long as it takes to ensure the public is safe,"" Comitta said. ""In addition to concerns raised by yesterday's and previous sinkholes in the Lisa Drive neighborhood, a 2017 leak caused by corrosion of this same aging pipeline in Morgantown led the PUC's BIE to recommend that Sunoco conduct a ""remaining life study"" of this 1931 pipeline and consider a plan to retire it. In my opinion it would be prudent for the PUC to require this study be completed and reviewed by independent experts prior to any consideration of restarting this pipeline.""

Chester County officials released a statement explaining that the sinkhole was caused by the failure of a water drainage system associated with the pipeline.

Tom Casey is a longtime critic of the pipeline plan. Mariner East runs right through his yard.

and also a resident in the neighborhood where the sinkholes have occurred. The pip

""Another day, another problem with the pipeline project in Chester County,” Casey said Monday. “Sunoco's engineered water remediation plan, according to Sunoco, has failed in the Lisa Drive region.

“During 2018, we saw countless trucks which dumped slurry into three separate sinkholes. With the realization of a new sinkhole, it was alarming to learn that residents were not being informed by Emergency Services of a threat because Sunoco claims there was no need to worry.

“Residents deserve a system that alerts them, not only of severe weather, school closings, or missing children, but of a comprehensive approach to pipeline emergencies that have a direct impact on their lives. What is the plan Chester County?”

T.J. Allen lives on Lisa Drive. A neighbor two houses away spotted the new sinkhole and exposed, working pipe.

“How can anybody say it’s safe?” Allen asked. “It’s absurd for anybody in their right mind to say it’s safe.”

Allen said the township response is “out of hand.”

“Once again West Whiteland Township (emergency responders) show up and talk to Sunoco instead of the residents.

“Where is the emergency response? We should have been evacuated. It’s the same thing over and over.""

A phone message was left with West Whiteland Township administrators but was not returned by press time, likely owing to the holiday.

Sunoco spokesperson Vicki Granado said in an emailed statement Monday that: ""In cooperation with the PA PUC’s Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement and its consultants, the parties have agreed that the Mariner East 1 line in this area will be purged of product while the subsidence is filled with specialized grouting to ensure it remains stable and geophysical testing is performed. Additionally, pipeline crews will actively monitor all Mariner East rights-of-ways in the area to ensure they remain safe and secure.

""There is no impact to the Mariner East 2 pipeline that runs through Chester County. Additionally, the 12-inch section of the Mariner East 1 line that is in temporary use as part of Mariner East 2 is not located in this area.""

Police said the sinkhole is 5 feet wide and 10 feet deep, and while the pipeline is exposed, it is not damaged.

The first sinkhole incident in West Whiteland occurred in November 2017. Drilling believed to be connected to Mariner East 2 is believed linked to the sinkhole, which exposed the older, existing Mariner East 2 pipeline.

Residents held protests at the site, noting the geology in the region lended itself to sinkholes.

The state Public Utility Commission shut down construction on the project in the wake of the pipeline, before eventually relenting and allowing construction to resume.

While Mariner East 1 has been online for months, Mariner East 2, a hybrid mix of several pipelines, went online Dec. 29. ETP and its affiliate Sunoco Pipeline went with the hybrid mix of pipes in this region to get the project online after a series of delays. 

Critics also questioned the safety of that move.

Eventually, the company plans to move hundreds of thousands of barrels of highly volatile liquid gases across the full width of the state to Marcus Hook.

Protesters have consistently questioned the notion of routing such materials through densely populated neighborhoods, in close proximity to schools and senior centers.

Just last week the state PUC rejected another petition for emergency relief from citizens. 

Just two weeks ago, Chester County District Attorney Tom Hogan announced he was opening a criminal investigation into construction of the pipeline, saying he was moving to protect concerns of residents and suggesting state officials had failed to do so.

The Mariner East project involves three separate pipelines, Mariner East 1, Mariner East 2 and Mariner East 2-x. Mariner East 1 is a smaller, old existing line, the company's old petroleum pipeline, that has been retrofitted to handle the liquid gas material. Mariner East 2 was proposed as a larger, 20-inch pipeline. The company has used several smaller lines to plug in gaps and put it online at the end of December. Mariner East 2x is still being constructed.

The Mariner East 2 project has been the focus of citizen protest and demonstrations for months.",1548170360,2,False,2qn7a,,,,0,,,,,,22-01-2019,07:19:20,,,,,aiarau,1

Almost all power generating plants are built with a 40+ year expected lifespan. Those 10 years are a simple incentive for the plant to be built in the area. This is done to bring industry (jobs), and reap the financial benefit of the other 30 years of taxes they *will* pay.

&gt; (power will be sent to NYC metro area, power costs will not go down due to it being in a network of plants, no tax breaks).

1. The power isn't ""sent somewhere"" in particular. The only thing PJM can do is tell a plant to run. (See PJM's map here: http://www.pjm.com/about-pjm/who-we-are/territory-served.aspx) 
2. Generating costs going down DOES lower you bill. NGCC is almost as cheap as nuclear these days. Feel free to shop for a new provider (http://www.papowerswitch.com/shop-for-electricity/) if you feel what you're paying is not fair.=. They're responsible for buying the generation for you, but they can't predict the future. 

&gt; There is no need to put this in a populated area without any contingency plans (where will the water come from in a drought? what will happen if it is a major accident?) These are things that have not yet been answered and are unprepared for.

This is a moot point. If there is a drought, they won't run or will install air-air cooling. Then water use is minimal. We are not in a drought and there is no sign that we will be any time soon. Again, there is *no fuel* stored on site. It uses fuel as it comes through the pipeline. It's incredibly safe and reliable technology. As soon as you close the valve, everything simply shuts down. 

&gt; If you were given an offer where you were going to lose 10% of your assets and were getting absolutely nothing in return, would you take the offer?

Assumptions won't win your battle. Do you have proof that this has happened in other areas? What if Amazon decided they wanted to build a 1 million square foot warehouse in the area. Would you be against that? I'm sure all the extra tractor trailer traffic wouldn't be good for noise and roads. People like to complain that there are no well-paying jobs, but fight every damn piece of industry that wants to build.
  
But anyways, I'm done with this. If you want to try to stop this from being built, I **highly** suggest some reading from the EPA, DOE, EPRI, NREL, etc. Your government is going to listen to concerns not backed up with fact. Speculation will not win. ",1421863825,1,,2qn7a,,,,0,,,,,,21-01-2015,10:10:25,,,,,2t2n3p,1
