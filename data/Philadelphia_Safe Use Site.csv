0,g5m3ef,n6ai5,,,,submission,redeyeblink,"&gt;MEAL SITE UPDATE: Grab-and-go meal distribution at our 49 District school sites will be shifting to one day per week.  
&gt;  
&gt;Every Thursday, beginning April 23, from 9 a.m. to noon, you will be able to pick up a box of 5 breakfast meals, five lunch meals and a ½ gallon of milk for each student in your family.  
&gt;  
&gt;Each box weighs six pounds so we encourage you to bring a wheeled cart or some other way to easily carry the boxes if you are picking up meals for multiple students in your household.  
&gt;  
&gt;The one-day-per-week schedule is a proactive measure we are taking to further support the City’s shelter-in-place guidance, minimize social interactions and help flatten the coronavirus curve. Social distancing, the use of masks and gloves, and other safety efforts will continue to be practiced to ensure everyone’s safety as meals are distributed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for supporting this important safety effort. For up-to-date information, visit www.philasd.org. Please take care and stay safe.

4,ge0mb,3jllw,,,,submission,Simon_the_Cannibal,"Hey All,

I just wanted to get your input on a number of things, and hopefully improve the subreddit in the process. As follows:

1. **The stickies up top**: We've had a proliferation of stickies; there are ten as of this writing. This presents problems, as I'm sure they've started to wrap around and look terrible on some of your screens. Should we:

    * Double the height of the logo (and possibly get a new one?) so that when stickies wrap around, it doesn't look extremely terrible?

    * Only list the next three events on the stickies and the rest either on the sidebar or unlisted? This would mean more work for me :( - but I'd do it.

    * Start culling stickies that are not explicitly meetups (e.g. Green Up, Pillow War, LAN)

    * Leave it, as it looks fine on my screen.

    **EDIT: 3/30 5pm** I've decided to restrict the stickies at the top to *finalized* events *planned and attended by redditors*. If it's an event that a group of redditors will be attending (or a meetup in planning), it may be listed on the sidebar.

2. As usual, feel free to edit the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Philadelphia/help/faqs/Philadelphia). The edit link is at the bottom of the FAQ - and [this](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/Philadelphia?action=edit) should take you directly to the edit page. The threads about ""where's a good place to..."" or ""can you recommend a..."" are good starting points. I don't know if it's still a little bitch, but F5 (refresh) usually solves most problems with the site.

3. I'm thinking of starting a 'shaming' regime. All in good fun, of course. Users who blatantly disregard rules or common etiquette (or asking another god damn question about Pat's and Geno's) might find themselves with a ""didn't read the sidebar"" note or similar (perhaps a Yankees/Mets logo for especially egregious offenses) appended to their names. *If you do or don't like this idea, let me know.* I think I would only take action if I received a number of complaints about a user.

4. **Moderator Questions:**

    * Is **mchadw** still around? Does he still lurk? Why is he a moderator if he doesn't contribute to the subreddit?

    * Similarly, does **doug3465** even subscribe to r/philly? I know he's an active redditor (some would even go as far to say a karma whore), but I've never seen him active here. He's done three things as far as moderation goes: he removed a spammy link, he made himself Will Smith, and he added a link to r/phillyroommates on the sidebar without consulting anyone.

    * I think we need another mod, if only so that when I fuck up ~~I can blame it on someone else~~ someone can fix it quickly. Preferably someone who knows a little bit about css and spends most of their time hitting F5 in r/philly.

5. Feel free to use this thread to request icons and other such changes, since the [old thread](http://redd.it/f62j1) has been archived. I will edit this post later to include an image with all icons available.

6. **The Spam Filter has been insane recently**, and you'd never notice. Apparently, it still shows a submitter's post in the 'new' and 'hot' threads now, even though it was caught. You actually have to log out to see whether or not your post was submitted (another good check: look at the twitter feed, though that will take up to a half hour to update). A recent post was double caught (caught again after I approved), and I had *no fucking clue that could happen*. Now I've been checking the filter daily, but that's no guarantee that your post is safe.

Alright, that about wraps it up. Is there anything I've been fucking up that I need to get better at?

This is a blatant falsehood that is easily dispelled by simply looking at [their website](https://www.safehousephilly.org/frequently-asked-questions#faqgeneral-whatis):

&gt;The organization seeks to open the first safe injection site in the U.S. providing a range of overdose prevention services, including safe consumption and observation rooms staffed by a medical staff prepared to administer overdose reversal if needed. **Additional services would include on-site initiation of Medically Assisted Treatment (MAT), recovery counseling, education about substance use treatment, basic medical services, and referrals to support services such as housing, public benefits, and legal services**.

But this is what you get when the mods allow conservatives to spread propaganda without repercussion while anyone who dares to pushback against their lies is held to a standard that mysteriously doesn't apply to the naysayers. I once had a comment removed for saying, ""it's foolish to believe"" because that's a ""personal attack,"" but apparently if you're against SIS you can call everyone else in the thread ""idiots"" or whatever other *ad hominem* you want and that's perfectly acceptable!

Edit: Even more from their website proving this is nonsense:

&gt;Participants will be presented with rehabilitation options at multiple points during their Safehouse visit, beginning with when they arrive and go through a registration process.  A physical and behavioral health assessment will be conducted, and a range of overdose prevention services offered.  
&gt;  
&gt;From the consumption area, participants will be directed to the medically supervised observation room and offered on-site initiation of Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT), wound care, and referrals to primary care, social services, and housing opportunities. Upon arrival, participants may choose to go directly to the observation room to access MAT and other services.  
&gt;  
&gt;Certified peer specialists, recovery specialists, social workers, and case managers will encourage treatment readiness and facilitate access to medical and social services. As participants leave, additional data will be collected, treatment, medical and social services will be offered again, and naloxone will be distributed.",1582738713.0,1,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,26-02-2020,09:38:33,,,,False,f9i5yl,1
16,fiu1ors,,f9lp9e,,,comment,AWierzOne,"I have mixed feelings about safe injection sites.  As an idea, I support it.  Give people a place to connect to resources to help them hopefully quit, or at least use their drugs safely to lower their chance of death.

My issue is that this effort doesn't seem connected to a wider approach to addressing drug use.  It feels like, and I may be ignorant of its connectivity to a more comprehensive effort here, this is just putting a band aid on an open wound.  Is this site aligned with recovery services that are capable of helping the people who go through here? Is it aligned with our criminal justice system and public health system, so that we can help people get better and prevent criminal activity?

The only reason the Convention Center is funding this is to get the homeless away from the eyes and wallets of tourists and the Center City wine and cheese crowd. The homeless are safer in Center City than they are in Kensington or Southwest Philly because there is less gunfire in Center City.  But I'm sure the Convention Center's ""solution"" will be to cluster the homeless services away from themselves.

The fatal flaw in this model is that it does not address is what do you do with people who refuse treatment because they are ""not ready"" and what to do about their drug dealers with guns:

-----------------------------------------------

&gt; Providing clean needles and not prosecuting heroin abuse as a crime is not helping either

It's almost like you just [aren't very informed](https://whyy.org/articles/syringe-exchange-saved-billions-in-hiv-related-costs-in-philadelphia-study-finds/)

&gt;Monica Ruiz, associate professor at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at Washington University and lead author on the study, said even after accounting for the estimated programming costs, the return on investment was $182.5 million a year in Philadelphia.

Maybe you just tricked yourself into thinking your preexisting biases were rational? 

&gt;So what are your ideas?

Four things could drastically reduce the *number* of heroin addicts by using evidence-based methods, although they require city, state, and federal collaboration:

* Deregulate suboxone so addicts can actually get prescriptions (currently the DEA limits the number of doctors who can prescribe it, and each doctor can only manage 25-100 prescriptions at a time, as a result addicts seeking recovery end up in ineffective 12-step programs or worse)

* Redesign drug courts to reduce the number of 12-step sentences, provide on-site medicaid enrollment support (so eligible defendants can get int residential rehabs), and allow residential sentences at state-run detox/rehab facilities that use evidence-based addiction treatment methods, as well as reintegration halfway houses that won't kick people out for pissing positive (i.e., relapse tolerant), but built around access to additional treatment (filling missing suboxone/methadone prescriptions, emergency relapse counselling, etc.)

* Require rehab facilities that accept medicaid to provide 1- and 5-year relapse statistics (demonstrating effectiveness) and kick ineffective rehabs off medicaid (eliminates the huge number of sham rehabs that sponge up medicaid dollars while dumping addicts back on the street)

* Mandate that all medicare/medicaid recipient hospitals across the country (basically all hospitals) provide methadone prescriptions (spreads the population of methadone users across the country, so all of central and eastern PA's addicts don't end up in Kensington)

These only address the demand side, to address drug supply:

* Significantly increase the number of detective seats in PPD, across the board (starting in the homicide division, but including major cases)

* Significantly increase the number of detectives working on (existing, successful) collaborations between the DA's office investigators, FBI/DEA investigators, and the US Attorney's office to interdict the major sources of heroin imports at the port

* Subvert demand for untraceable Chinese cannabinoid analogs (which create the internet supply pipelines for later shipments of Chinese fentanyl and carfentanyl) by legalizing and regulating recreational cannabis and MDMA (among other drugs)

And finally, yes:

* Build safe injection sites because it saves lives.",1573765747.0,1,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,14-11-2019,13:09:07,,,,False,dwa0h2,1

There can be, and there has. They've been sweeping corners down there on and off for at least 20 years. It hasn't had a great effect. Cops go away, dealers and users come back.

Long-term, we have to stop viewing drugs as a moral failing and a law enforcement problem. Cops have known this for decades. Addiction is a public health issue, and needs to be treated that way. We're slowly moving that way. To me, the SIS is a step in that direction. It's a first step, and I won't lie to you and say it's going to make your life better right now. It won't.

36,epgqkd5,,bufwpl,,,comment,carlislecowboys,"I've seen a lot of people concerned that these sites would just open up new business to dealers and allow them to target an already vulnerable group. I don't think this is a valid argument against safe injection sites but I have a friend who work with a few organizations in Kensington specifically dealing with resources for homeless women, sex workers, and drug users and addicts. They mentioned that people have started selling directly outside one of their buildings and subsequently the police moved in to try and make some arrests. It obviously drives people away from seeking out services like these, since a bunch of police waiting right outside can make things pretty intimidating. It's a shame that people have to feel unsafe going to places designed to help those in need.

That said, I'm in favor of the site because they provide a solution to an already significant problem. Kensington is one of the main shipping locations on the east coast for all sorts of hard drugs (H, PCP, Meth), and that massive amount and availability leads to use on the street often in the immediate area. I don't care if they change locations to appease the community, because residents should have the most important say in the matter as the presence of a safe injection site is itself a community issue, but we need them somewhere in this city. Safe Injection Sites are designed to provide a safer and healthier environment by ensuring the quality of the drug, providing clean needles and proper disposal of hazardous waste, providing trained medical staff if needed, and preventing overdoses. People in our city are dying from unsafe drug practices. People will continue to use drugs, and if they are not given a safe space they will continue to die. This is a city-wide (and honestly, national) community issue and if we don't address it members of our community will continue to suffer from untested, unsafe paraphernalia getting cut with increasingly more toxic fillers. These discussions often end up in an us vs them of ""normal people"" and ""junkies"" but this is an internal issue. *We* have an opiod problem, *we* have an overdose problem, and *we* need to support the people who are suffering from how large these issues have gotten. The drug trade systematically capitalizes on those already struggling by offering a quick reprieve from real world problems, and over time that can lead to a very real physical dependency on the substance. Programs like these are trying to give back some agency to drug users by ensuring they are safe. Nobody working at a safe injection site is supporting the heroin problem, they are supporting heroin users. Whether that's wrong or not is a matter of moral opinion, but currently these are the best option besides standalone treatment centers.",1559217103.0,0,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,30-05-2019,04:51:43,,,,False,bufwpl,1

The resources they know are available at a SIS would likely cause guilt and shame creating even more of a deterrent. I dont blame you in anyway for the way you feel. I sympathize if anything. I've been there. I will agree however that it is a problem. An opiate addiction is a vicious roller coaster that literally never ends. No matter how much fun, at some point you just want to get off. The common phrase of ""chasing the dragon"" is all too real. Addicts use to feel good, but will never feel better than the very first time they get high. After the first time it's literally all downhill. For a time it's a fun ride. Then they become addicted and it's not fun anymore. Getting high just feels normal. At this point you either seek help or allow your life to begin to fall away. 

The street junkies you despise are just a portion of those affected by the opiate crisis. These are not the people we would see at safe injection sites. Short of not having a needle these people will primarily use elsewhere.

There is no cure for an opiate addiction. Prevention and education are the best weapons against the current crisis.

38,ekprwr0,,ekpiwtf,,,comment,phil_e_delfian,"We don't totally disagree. I don't think it's good or healthy to have so much addiction concentrated in one area. I sympathize with the people who live there. It's just that supply follows demand, and there has been demand down there for 50 plus years now.

Thirty five years ago, a friend (the Captain of a pretty large city's drug squad) told me that all the police could ever really do is move the problem around, and the only way we'd ever really deal with it is to legalize drugs and treat the addiction as a public health issue. After 35 years of the war on drugs, it's pretty obvious he was right.

All moving dealers from neighborhood to neighborhood does is create new opportunities for turf wars over the new marketplace. That's never a good thing.

You're right that Street did some good, but the biggest thing he did was NTI, which cleared out a lot of the abandoned properties used as shoot galleries and flop housed. It wasn't uncommon to peel back the plywood (when there was any) on those old shells over there and find five or six people shooting up in there. I remember when the area between 46th and 50th and Market was almost as bad. It wasn't the police who cleaned that up. Largely, it was Penntrification. Demand dried up. Places to sell and shoot up were suddenly occupied.

Would I want to see a safe injection site in Society Hill? Of course not. Not because of the pristine wealth of the neighborhood, but because no one would use it. They go to K&amp;S because that's where the dope is, with or without the safe injection site. And they're not going wait to  go half way across town to shoot up.

Is any of this ideal? No. Is it a step in the right direction? I think so. The real significance of the safe injection site is that it's a step in the right direction. Toward a real solution to help clean up Kensington and so many other areas. Stop punishing addicts for some sort of imagined moral failure. Treat them as people with a health problem, and treat the problem. Ultimately, legalize it. Sell it through dispensaries or pharmacies or whatever, and operate them like any other business.

Second, most Philadelphia residents would not accept a SIS in their district. I wouldn't. A protest will not change this.

I'm not a fan of safe-injection sites for a few reasons and one of which is the enabling factor which you understand.  That reason is why I don't support legalization but would consider / support decriminalization.

Here are a few of the other major issues I have with the sites:

1. **There's no requirement to seek rehabilitation or cease usage.** These sites act to prolong an addict's usage rather than persuade them to stop.  Their main goal is to keep people alive but someone could have an overdose prevented and be allowed to go right back to using the same day.  There's no requirement to go through rehabilitation or stop using.  I think this safety-net could lead to a vicious cycle of ever-increasing dosages.

1. **Not as many people overdose on site.** Looking at [Vancouver's statistics](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/is-vancouvers-safe-drug-use-site-a-good-model-for-seattle/) people overdosing at these sites are relatively few in number.  In 2015 for instance the site saw ~264k visits and encountered only ~770 overdoses during that time.  That's a relatively small number considering the total number of visits and total cost.  Local city council has currently _[estimated](https://dbhids.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/OTF_Comprehensive-User-Engagement-Site-Report-clean_jg.pdf)_ that annually they would see 24k visits and prevent 24 to 76 overdoses.

1. **The site itself would be considered a blight on the surrounding community.** Lot's of residents have expressed not wanting the site itself to be hosted near them.  It's introduction into a community certainly won't be good for property values or local businesses.  Some people suggest putting it in the communities which have been hit the hardest already, but wouldn't that just keep those communities permanently locked into addiction?  Plus nobody realizes how there are going to be addicts loitering around the site 24/7 and dealers will be serving their clients.

   &gt; “What does the temptation of easy money in an impoverished community do to our young people in that community, for the sake of giving white kids from the suburbs a place to legally shoot an illegal substance,” asked Wilson.

    [source](http://planphilly.com/articles/2018/02/12/what-safe-injection-sites-sound-like-to-people-on-the-front-lines-of-the-city-s-drug-wars)

1. **Dealers get to operate in a legal grey-zone.**   They will undeniably be safer legally but also stand to benefit from people using the sites themselves.  If they're caught with their product they can just say they were on their way to the safe-injection site as if it were a get out of jail free card.  I think the sites will attract more dealers which will eventually lead to fights over territory.

1. **Safe-injection sites treat a symptom of a larger problem.** These sites do nothing to address the reasons people are becoming addicted to the drug and instead focus on side-effects of using the drug.  In the past [fifteen years](https://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/purdue-health/a-brief-history-of-opioids/184/) we've allowed pharmaceutical companies to offer broader varieties of addictive opioids in an effort to address ""pain management"" after they suggested [patients wouldn't become addicted](https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/about-the-epidemic/index.html) or dependent.  Among new heroin users, approximately [three out of four](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/heroin.html) report having abused prescription opioids prior to using heroin.

    Limiting the availability of these opioids in both the pharmaceutical and street realms are what we need to be targeting in my opinion.",1518585180.0,-3,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,13-02-2018,21:13:00,,,,True,7xcf8d,1
54,dtdahet,,7tl7y5,6qhpu,,comment,Brioux,"&gt; “That place would be an open invitation for people to get high,” said Nikki Rosario, 35, a newlywed who works as an administrative assistant in the city.

&gt;“And more people will come here to do it,” said Victor Rodriguez, 63, a retired accountant on a block whose residents have negotiated to keep drug dealers away, and so don’t want their street identified. “Everybody’s scared of that.”

--

&gt; Residents of this area — the epicenter of the crisis in  Philadelphia, which has the highest overdose death rate of any major American city — say they’ve shouldered a heavy burden already. They are frustrated they have few details on the sites, where people would be able to use drugs under medical supervision, be revived if they overdose, and access treatment and other services.

--

&gt; Yet reactions here do not line up neatly in us-against-them order. The one unifying belief: Whatever else happens, Kensington needs much more than a safe injection site.
&gt; 
&gt; Jessie Alejandro-Cruz, director of Mothers Mission, a local advocacy group, was checking on the well-being of drug users with her friend Charito Morales, a nurse and activist. She wants something different for the community than sanctioned places to inject drugs. “We’ve suffered enough. Kensington doesn’t deserve this.”

--

&gt; Inside the office, Lourdes Terreforte, the parish secretary, sighed. Her son, who’s 34, has been addicted to heroin for three years and is in prison.

&gt; She understands that a safe injection site would likely decrease public drug use. But she can’t get past the idea of a city-sanctioned space to use drugs, even in a neighborhood where drug use is already so visible: “That’s giving them more right to shoot up heroin.”

--

&gt; “An injection site may keep users off the street, but my faith tells me it may contribute to addiction,” said Marerro. “For me, that’s confliction, brother.”

&gt; ###In addiction, wanting a way out

&gt; There was an outlier: Jessica Bradshaw, 40, pushing her blond hair out of her eyes as she plopped onto a discarded office chair, said she needed a “place to get my [stuff together], not a place to shoot up — why not build a shelter?”",1517157184.0,2,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,28-01-2018,08:33:04,,,,True,7tl7y5,1
55,dt65z71,,7snpe2,88u66,,comment,Scumandvillany,"“When Vancouver opened a safe injection site in 2003, for example, the Canadian government established a legal exemption allowing people to use illegal substances at the site, according to the head of the police union, Tom Stamatakis.
But Stamatakis said Tuesday that it was still illegal to buy or sell the drugs, and dozens of police officers were deployed to the neighborhood of the safe injection site to help prevent increases in petty or drug-related crimes.
“There are issues there you have to carefully consider,” he said.”

Above is a quote from the article. 

This is exactly what is lacking from the proposal.  

Where is the plan for increased police presence? 

SIS is one facet in an overarching strategy.

Where is the enforcement on the other side of the coin, like major crimes units getting more funding to go after the big players-coordinated investigations with the ATF, DEA, and federal authorities?  Not there. They should have a better plan in place before they attempt this or it is going to backfire and fail.

Either way, mandatory treatment of all zombies wandering around Kensington is paramount to improve the quality of life for the people that live there.  (Like me) Loitering and public intoxication is against the law. Send em up to a drug court tent, then to detox and vivitrol. Give them support with caseworkers to reconcile with their loved ones and provide support for job training and placement. Hell, subsidize their life until they can get it together. Yes this will cost money. Yes, it’s bold. Float a bond issue and hire the police and support personnel necessary. Watch the city recover and bloom.

If you think safe-injection sites are going to stop heroin users from shooting up anywhere else, you're severely mistaking.  They may inject at the site, but they'll still inject at home, over their dealer's, and anywhere else they get the hankering to try.

Even if they decide to only use at a site, if you've ever had anyone close to you use heroin you know they're a shell of the person they once were when using.  You don't get extra time with your loved one if their OD is prevented and they don't get clean afterwards.  Heroin steal's people's lives from them.

It's why places like Vancouver are second-guessing their approaches.

Bullshit.  The opioid usage surge has happened over the past ten years give or take.  The existing ""policies"" have been in place for much longer.

People that actually analyze the rise in usage suggest that it's partially due to availability and partially due to our economic situation.  Policies designed to take the supply off the streets while our economy continues to grow will inevitably result in fewer people turning to heroin.

The other issues which people love to gloss over are the over-prescription of opioids from doctors.  Many people's addiction starts from a legal source.  We need to crack down on doctors and companies that recklessly push opioids onto their patients.

Past that, we also need to make available rehabilitation and mental health treatments for those who are currently using and want a way out.

__Analysis: Amid opioid abuse crisis, safe injection sites are a step forward__


By Nathaniel P. Morris, 05/12/16 

“Other parts of the world have effectively answered that question for us: Supervised injection sites have existed for years in countries like Canada, Australia, Spain, and Switzerland. According to a 2015 report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, decades of international research have found “no evidence to suggest that the availability of safer injecting facilities increases drug use or frequency of injections.”

“Instead, this report details a long list of public health benefits from these facilities. Research suggests safe injection sites lead to reduced numbers of fatal overdoses, decreased risky injection behaviors, decreased public drug use, and increased entry into drug treatment. In one striking example, a 2011 study of a Vancouver injection site found the rate of overdose deaths decreased by 35 percent in the surrounding area following the facility’s opening.”

“The idea of supervised injection sites is spreading nationwide. Policymakers in California, Massachusetts, and Washington, among other places, are now considering similar proposals. Last year, the editorial board of The Boston Globe came out in favor of safe injection sites.”

“Thousands of Americans are dying as the opioid crisis rages across the country. Why are we still resisting evidence-based approaches to save them?”

I would say that there is a major difference between methadone clinics and safe sites, mainly in that you are centralizing drug *distribution* with the former. In areas where open air drug use is already centralized, these safe injection sites have no impact on crime and positive impacts on public health.

That may be true. And yet in 2016, a few months after Kenney enacted the change, he used a slight decrease in crime as proof that the policy was effective. The crime rate has inched up again, and suddenly folks like you are again arguing ""correlation != causation"". Yes, opioids may be a factor. That's traditionally been the worst in areas with high unemployment, and Philly's unemployment rate is higher than both the state and national levels. However, the opioid crisis has been ongoing for several years and isn't something that suddenly started in 2016 when Kenney took office.

The theory in favor of sanctuary cities is that it encourages illegal immigrants to report crimes and cooperate with police investigating non-immigration related crimes. If this theory were true, then there'd be higher crime outside of sanctuary cities, but the opposite is true. Lookup crime heat-maps on any real-estate listing site, and some of the highest levels will be in neighborhoods with high populations of illegal-immigrants, Philly included. As soon as I drive outside of Philly's city limits, the probability of me getting shot or mugged drops significantly.

The concept of the sanctuary city is naive and ignores how criminals, especially organized gangs, will still use threats of violence to hamper witnesses from cooperating with police. So you're left with a policy that attracts criminals who know they'll be safe from police.",1501549881.0,1,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,31-07-2017,18:11:21,,,,True,6pz7u9,1

of arrest, detox in jail and turfed back onto the street is literally just a perpetuation of police policy over the last 50+years and has proven itself over to be ineffective i.e. The war on drugs.  

This program has the potential to take the strain off of emergency services and contribute to a better public health situation by lowering the spread of HIV, Hepatitis and a whole host of communicable diseases.  So in the long term it's an investment in public health not just a ""place for addicts to get high at our expense.""

[This document](http://www.ohtn.on.ca/Pages/Knowledge-Exchange/Rapid-Responses/Documents/RR83-Supervised-Injection-Effectiveness.pdf) from Ontario HIV Treatment Network going over supervised injection, since Ontario is also looking into funding safe injection sites. (I know it's not in the US, but it's good info)   
Here are the bullet points, I suggest also reading the document in full:

#What is the effectiveness of supervised injection services?  
**Question**  
*What is the effectiveness of supervised injection services?*   
  
**Key Take-Home Messages**  
  
- The use of supervised injection services can lead to reductions in injecting behaviour and an increase in the number of clients accessing addiction treatment services.
- Supervised injection services can be cost saving when the analysis takes into account their capacity to reduce transmission of blood-borne diseases, namely HIV and HCV.  
- People who inject at supervised injection sites feel safer than those who inject publically.  
- Overdose morbidity and mortality are reduced when clients inject at supervised injection sites. Clients who inject at supervised injection sites receive education on safer injecting practices that helps reduce injection-related morbidity.  
- When nursing care is provided at supervised injection sites, clients access nursing services frequently.  
- Supervised injection sites do not lead to any significant disruptions in public order or safety in the neighbourhoods where they are located.  
- Supervised injection sites pose a few challenges based on their operating models and regulations: if capacity does not meet demand there may be long lines that dissuade some clients from injecting at the facility; there will still be times when clients have no choice but to inject elsewhere when facilities are not open 24 hours per day, 7 days a week; some clients cannot inject independently and will not use supervised injection services that prohibit assisted injections; and when facilities prohibit splitting or sharing drugs on site, some clients might be excluded. 

----------------------------------

Also, Here is a paper written on safe injection sites. More good info.

82,dhss90d,,dhsr20i,88u66,this_shit,comment,SpOoKy_EdGaR,"I edited the shit out of my comment so not sure if you saw that, but in case you did and need further clarification, harm reduction is things life safe sites. Needle exchange trucks, nurses volunteering to perform injections etc. as far as I know for opiates. But the user is still totally unaware of what is in their bag. Is it heroin and alcohol? Fentanyl? How strong? What ratios? The OD comes from using a larger amount than your body has tolerance for, so even if heroin wasn't cut with anything you can die from a dose. If it's cut with fentanyl you're gambling even harder. The safe sites, as far as I know, don't screen for the chemical composition of the substances that clients use on site. Since they can't realistically assess the client's tolerance, but they're about to administer a dose anyways, you have to worry whether or not the user may OD based on the purity. Then you factor in what it's cut with. Another OD risk. Since the OD deaths come from using too much of something you don't have tolerance for, I think that unless these sites can somehow assess these factors and control for them when dosing clients, it doesn't do much other than provide a temporary and false sense of safety. I appreciate your respect for the field, and I wouldn't want cops writing policy either. I totally admit that I'm biased (I work in treatment). But even trying to be objective, it's such a complex and dangerous thing to try to do safely - I feel like the harm reduction is in things with no immediately relevant benefit (clean needles so no HIV, avoiding using the same vein to prevent vein collapse, giving out hygiene or ""doing therapy"" as you dose a client - crock of shit imo) compared to what might be gained if an equal force in time, effort and money went to treatment funding and community education and outreach. For what it's worth I have a degree in community psychology and used to be very into substance abuse and harm reduction, but as I work on my MSW and continue to work ""on the ground"", my perspective has entirely shifted. It really changed for me when I got in the field and out of the classroom. I readily admit this as limiting even the degree to which I can be objective, but having spent a shitload of time studying this stuff and then getting out into the field itself really changed how I look at this all. I wasn't going to comment because I don't like to feel exposed like this, but I appreciate your sensitivity to the whole thing.

83,dhsqw4y,,dhsnil1,b0ynw,ghost_of_deaf_ninja,comment,SpOoKy_EdGaR,"I work with addicts and 100% think we need to work on ending the problem more than harm reduction. It's a band aid that doesn't do much to stop the bleeding at the source. Treatment and prevention stop people from using, and that should be the goal. If a user decided not to go get treatment because they could ""use safely"" this afternoon at the ""safe site"" (and I wonder how they define this safety), but then needs a fix that night when the site is closed or unstaffed or the truck left or whatever the circumstance is such that they don't have access to it, and the user ODs and dies, then what? How do you tell yourself this was ok? Because at least he was safe for a little bit? Not to mention that the addict's quality of life is likely still awful. This does absolutely nothing to better the life of an addict who is homeless and robbing people to fund their addiction. They continue the same harmful and dangerous behaviors that extend outside of their own life and into the lives of others. If the money that is put towards this was instead used for treatment outreach and growth of treatment programs that user could've instead learned of a rehab with a bed open for them and transportation ready to pick them up. They could have stayed alive and had a chance at life. When I think of it on these terms I cannot advocate prioritizing harm reduction over treatment. There are too many holes in reduction that put more lives at risk than would otherwise be if the same human effort and financial power went toward treatment programs.

And you talk about this like the epidemic has been ongoing for 50 years. Opiate addiction skyrocketed within the last 15 years or so after the enormous increase in px of painkillers which were originally marketed to docs by the pharmaceutical companies as non-addictive. Do we need a change to combat the epidemic? Yes. But imo (as someone who works in addiction and has worked with literally hundreds of heroin addicts young and old) putting money towards something that makes it easier to continue addiction, when that money could have gone towards treatment and outreach, is unequivocally the wrong choice.",1495253307.0,7,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,19-05-2017,21:08:27,,,1495254701,,6c58tt,1

Is what I was referring to.  You keep changing the subject, even in your post.  There are 3 different issues here: 1) trolling, 2) ""hate speech"" &amp; 3) death threats.  If you wanna ban people for trolling, whatever.  But you said that you'll ban people just for expressing opinions that someone (ie you) deemed to be alt-right; this is censorship.  Even if you keep calling it ""hate speech"", it's censorship.  And when you ban (i.e. censor) people for their *ideas* instead of the way those ideas are expressed, eg through trolling or rule-breaking, then you are arbitrarily censoring people which makes you the bad guy to a lot of people.  If you said ""this isn't a political sub, so we'll ban you for discussing politics"", that'd be one thing, but you're saying political discussions are ok as long as your ideas fall within the range of what I consider acceptable.  Most people on reddit do not like this kind of autocratic censorship, and as I said before, you're going to drive people towards the alt-right and away from this sub.  




As for people receiving death threats, that's against site rules and it's illegal.  You should report them to reddit and the police and ban them if you want.

87,db5prka,,db5kz97,101vbj,WheresRet,comment,this_shit,"&gt; maybe we should focus on the causes of heroin use

They aren't mutually exclusive. You can (and we should!) focus on both at the same time. Safe injection sites should focus on keeping people alive at the lowest financial and human cost. But they should also provide access to treatment options for people who want a way out. Obviously most addicts won't walk into a safe injection site and immediately get clean, but the only way to make sure someone will **never** get clean is for them to OD. 

As for costs, there's a massive unseen cost to the status quo, both in terms of explicit financial costs, and implicit opportunity costs. 

Explicit costs of junkies without safe places to inject include:

* ER visits and EMS calls: Conservative estimates would be $500-$1000 per EMS call, and several thousand for an ER visit. Plus, the cost of the drugs themselves. If a shelter could avoid one EMS call per month, they'd already be making rent.

* Long-term healthcare costs: safe injection sites would facilitate the distribution of clean needles, reducing the long-term costs of new HIV infections. 

* Crime-associated direct costs: safe injection sites would reduce crime associated with street loitering and life. This includes basic property crime, but can also include some violent crime.

Although the explicit financial costs are high, the implicit costs of street junkies are much greater, and include a wide variety of things:

* Quality of life-related impacts (including property values): junkies using on the street contribute to a number of undesirable QoL outcomes like more loitering, littering, robbery, and street crime. These, in turn, destroy tremendous value for property owners

* Sunk child-rearing and educational costs: This is related to the last bullet below, but in this country, every person gets a free elementary-high school education. This comes at an extraordinary cost (~$200k, on average, if I remember correctly). All of this investment in a person is wasted if they die, or remain an addict.

* Grieving costs: When a junkie dies, they are sometimes survived by grieving family members and loved ones who experience real harm by their loss. Making economic estimates of these types of loss is very difficult (""would you rather have $100k or your son back? $500k?""), but they are nonetheless real. 

* Lost productivity: Perhaps the most important cost, when a junkie dies (or, alternatively, just fails to get clean), all of their future potential disappears, and we all lose. I don't mean that in a new-agey way. I mean, they could have been a construction worker, or a retail clerk, or an engineer, who provided added value to the economy by selling their labor for a wage. Instead, they're gone. ",1481664857.0,4,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,13-12-2016,13:34:17,,,,,5hyeur,1

89,d7mlbvo,,52q2by,5fln6,,comment,DopeYeti,"Welcome to Philly! It's a shame you won't be staying for longer, but you're going to have a great mini-day while you're here. This is what I suggest to make the most of your time here, allotting about 5 hours of ""City Time"" to play it safe:

1.Take the SEPTA airport line to Jefferson Station: It's cheap, leaves every 30 mins, and takes only 30 mins to put you right in the heart of center city. This stop will be after Suburban Station so you can keep a heads up on when to get off. (30 mins)

2.Eat lunch in Reading Terminal Market: After arriving at Jefferson Station, you'll want to walk north up 11th St., then make a left either on Filbert St. or Arch St. Both streets will lead you to Reading Terminal, which is rather large. Give yourself under an hour to explore the vendors and have a bite or two, but if it's super crowded don't bother staying any longer just to wait in lines. For vendors, I recommend Termini Brothers, DiNics, Beiler's, and Famous 4th Street Cookies. (30-45 mins)

3.Take a walk through Chinatown towards Independence Hall: This is only about a 10 min walk. After leaving Reading Terminal, walk east down Arch St. You'll pass the famous Chinatown Friendship Arch at 10th and Arch, and enjoy fun sights and smells from the East Asian vendors. Keep walking down Arch,  then make a right on 6th St. Walk south until you reach Market St. Here, you'll find the Independence Visitor Center. (15 mins)

4.Take the Hop-On Hop-Off Big Bus Tour: I cannot recommend this enough!!! I'm a Philly native, have taken the tour several times myself, and use this as my go-to recommendation for visitors. You'll purchase the tickets at the visitor center. The entire tour takes you to 27 stops throughout Philadelphia, and allows you to hop off the bus, explore the attraction/neighborhood, and hop back on when the next bus comes in 15 minutes! There's no way you could cover this much ground on your own. The tour guides are well informed, entertaining, and provide a great tour of everything you need to know about Philly. The entire tour takes an hour and a half, but below I've recommended several stops to get off at and explore. (90 mins) 

* The Philadelphia Museum of Art: Yes, you can to run up the Rocky Steps here. But it also offers one of the most beautiful views of the Philly skyline once you've reached the top of the steps. (15-20 mins)

* Penn's Landing/Waterfront: Spruce Street Harbor Park is a summer staple here in Philly. It has many food and drink vendors, a floating bar area on the Delaware River, and some hammocks and lounge chairs to relax on. (30-45 mins)

5.Get off the bus at Old City/Christ's Church: This is basically Ben Franklin-ville. It's also one of the last stops on the tour, so it makes sense to just stay off here. This is where you can find the locations of his first home, his post office, his printing press, as well as his burial site. But, if you walk to 2nd St., you'll also find many of Philly's best bars, two of my favorites being Sassafras and Khyber Pass. (60 mins).

6.Head back to the airport via uber/cab: Both of these forms of transport will be super easy to pick up in Old City. Plus you'll be right next to I-95 so it'll be the fastest and cheapest route back to the city, only 15 mins, and cost only $10-15. There's no sense in traveling all the way back to center city to take a 30 minute train ride back to the airport. Also, the train can be unreliable so you don't want to bank on that being your mode of transportation to your departing flight.  


If you follow this plan to the minute, you'll spend exactly 5 to 5.5 hours in the city. That should give you plenty of time to travel in and out of Philly and still make your flight in time. Plus, you can choose to shave off time here and there at various spots I've recommended to play in safe. If you need to take away anything from this list though, definitely take the bus tour! It's the best way to see the most in a short period of time in our historic city.

Have fun, and enjoy Philly! Feel free to PM me with any questions :)

Now I am faced with ongoing testing and the need to get vaccinated for Hepatitis in hopes it will prevent any exposure.

&gt; According to my doctor, the blood testing should go on for at least 6 months or more because the virus can lie dormant for months before it is detected.   During that time I need to take every precautions as if I were HIV positive or have Hepatitis B or C.  Without going into detail you can all imagine what that may mean.

93,ceqo1md,,cejdjgn,4m321,JawsJVH,comment,[deleted],"So first understand my position.  Working for a manufacturing company.  I deal with the site visits and aiding in minimizing the NOV's (Notice of Violations).  My real job is unrelated, but my degree pulls me in that direction when the situation calls for it.  As with most industrial companies, we have a bit of regulated pollution, no big deal, just we keep pollution under certain limits such as our oil burner for our two main boilers for steam.

Now when the DEP gets involved, its for one of two main things.  Either A:  Site visit, or B:  We are changing something that involves what they have deemed as important to them.  I'll go over why each of these separately.

Site visits:  Every year they make a stop to see the site.  The guy has this notebook and a clipboard along with a computer.  We take him on the floor and he asks to see a number of places on site.  For instance, the boilers as I mentioned before.  He'll walk down, look at it for a minute, and then continues his journey.  He will look at each of our pollution causing machines and finally sit down in a conference room to review some paperwork we've kept over the past year. 
Why is this useless?  Our paperwork while it is correct, doesn't necessarily need to be, and his tour certainly didn't help him determine true emission of pollutants.  If my company wanted to falsify documents, I can promise you we would get away with it.  Of course, we don't and also we don't need to.  But if we had say a massive spill and kept it a secret, the DEP would not find out by this auditing method.  It is up to the members of the company to assess, document, and notify the DEP.  In fact, the only thing the DEP learns from the site visit is who the new low man on the totem pole is, such as myself.  The visit is more for keeping up appearances, shaking hands, and making sure all those machines we had last year are still being used.  (If we take them offline for over a year we need to notify the DEP and before we turn them back on we need to notify.)

Now for the changes.  Much like the example above, when we remove or put in place a new machine that creates emissions that fall into the realm of the DEP we must notify them.  The process takes six months, after of course, the 40 page notification is written.  I don't know what occurs in this six months, although I can be sure nothing that should legitimately take six months.  This is where the DEP could be useful.  It is this step that allows the state to control what chemicals are emitted into the air.  However, with a bit of science, confusion, and wording, industries can get nearly whatever they want.  For instance, imagine a reaction vessel that was bought for multiple chemical processes.  During the plant application, the exhaust may only have been meant for steam removal.  However, after installation, there is nothing to keep this vessel from partaking in a reaction that creates HCl or worse as a byproduct.  Another example can be related to a plant in the Reading area.  Carpenter Tech uses HF to pickle metal.  They collect emission data by testing one day and multiplying over the month and year.  This test only occurs once or twice in the lifetime of a acid tank.  Meaning, if production and thus pollution goes up, the calculated emissions would not automatically adjust.  The only way someone could be sure is if the DEP's site visit included an impromptu pollution test (known as a stack test).  Of course the DEP doesn't have the money for this involvement though.  And thus require compliance from companies in order to maintain control.  They use strict penalties and hefty fines to scare people away from immoral decisions, but often it is only morals which keep the information flowing often and accurately.

My stance is that most companies care about the environment and do their best to protect it.  There are only a few bad eggs.  The DEP has become too disconnected from the industrial processes they are involved in.  A generation of Environmental Science majors are running around as if they have degrees in the three fields of science and every engineering degree invented.  Most DEP site inspectors know nothing about chemical processing and simply nod their heads while big words swirl around their brains until someone says a key word like stack test, NOV, or hazardous waste.

In conclusion, what the DEP is trying to do is over their heads.  A lot of money is spent purely to scare people into obeying the laws.  If employees were instead empowered to regulate their own companies, I feel a similar system could exist where engineers and management could work together to create an environmentally safe place to work.  Perhaps a world where if a law was broken whistle blowing could exist in some way.  Idk... all I know is the DEP is wasteful, they make my company wasteful, and all to control waste...  If we could spend the money and time instead to make our process less wasteful, everyone would save money.

This was kinda rushed, but if you have any questions about specifics let me know.",1389837140.0,2,,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,15-01-2014,17:52:20,,,,,1sbmm1,1
