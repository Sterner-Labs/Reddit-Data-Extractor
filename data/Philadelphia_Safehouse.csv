1 - their software is absolute garbage, it's not too long ago that they were using lotus sheets in their accounting department. They're way overdue for an upgrade, but honestly it's not that surprising. When Rhynhart says it is fixed i'm inclined to believe her. The controller has been amazing compared to the hacks in the past.

2 - i think this just synced up with planned reassessments... people got dinged and yes, it's the city's fault, but also plenty of land/buildings were severely undervalued for so long. The reassessment hasn't gone perfectly, and in many cases it is straight trash. But i don't think it's tied to amazon.

3 - agree with the sentiment, but OTOH a trashed lot generating negative value for the city being replaced by a new townhome with presumably high earners provides way more revenue to the city. if that's what it takes to draw in investment then personally i'm ok with it (keep in mind, the abatement isn't really for the people living there... it's for the developers. the buyers pay for this in the purchase price. it's caked in so the developers can charge a higher amount to compensate for our higher labor costs in the city). This is also partially recouped initially by an inflated purchase price which drives a higher transfer tax that is captured by the city. All i want to say is that this isn't a black and white issue.

4 - agree 

5 - disagree completely. there are cars on my block that haven't moved in over 6 - 12 months. if street cleaning gets them towed, i'm happy. calls / app requests on 311 do jack shit. if this is paired with permitting areas so only residents can park for extended periods of time, its a good thing.

Not to mention Safehouse and other SIS proposals are immensely unpopular in Philadelphia, for good reason IMO.  While it would prevent drug addicts from dying, an SIS would so next to nothing to curb the presence of drug addicts in our city, and would actually exponentially increase the amount of homeless addicts congregating near wherever it is built.  I'll let you guess which one of those things most normal people who live, work, recreate, and/or own property or businesses in this city care about.

Here's a better solution. Double the State Income Tax from 3% to 6%.  Use all of that money to create an asylum system and to improve the economic aid for those experiencing homelessness due to economic factors (e.g. temporary free housing).  Set those systems up then you scoop up every homeless person you find and process them as follows - 

Is family willing to take them in? If yes, good, give them to family and inform them that they will have to go to mandatory rehabilitation or mental health appointments to fix their issues.

Nowhere to go?  They get involuntarily committed to the new asylum system for forced rehabilitation and/or mental health treatment until they are well enough to leave.  People leaving the asylum system will also go through here for further help to get back on their feet.

Homeless because of economic hardship? Set them up with state or city funded temporary housing and a social worker to help them find work to get back on their feet.

At the same time, arrest and prosecute every drug dealer you can find with harsh prison sentences.  Oh and legalize weed and other drugs that do not have negative societal effects (i.e. mushrooms, other psychedelics, etc.).

Too bad everything I just said is just as much of a pipe dream as the systems they have in the Netherlands.",1594823550.0,0,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,15-07-2020,07:32:30,,,,False,hr7bbh,1

""While there were no deaths recorded among people who used drugs at the SCS sites, death rates in the immediate vicinity of the SCS locations increased. Opioid-related calls for emergency medical services (EMS) also increased in the immediate vicinity following the opening of the sites.""

""In many cases, “adverse events” (even if non-life threating or minor) are reported as overdoses, and the term “reversal” is used even when the response was a simple administration of oxygen. This leaves the public with an inference that without these sites thousands of people would fatally overdose or no longer be alive. Comparatively rare cases resulted in the use of naloxone. As a result, the committee became concerned with issues of transparency and accountability with the regards to the way overdose reversals are tracked and reported. The committee finds this misleading and the ambiguity and faulty reporting cannot responsibly make such a determination.""

"" The Committee heard reports of inadequate oversight and the lack of accountability mechanisms at the sites. Record keeping at the sites was and continues to be reportedly inconsistent, standardized definitions of concepts such as adverse events were absent, and no mechanisms appeared to be in place to assess the veracity of periodic reports submitted by the sites to Alberta Health.""

""The Committee became concerned with the lack of focus on referrals to detoxification and treatment resources. Where it was suggested that referrals were made, no evidence was found to support action taken to follow up on such referrals. ""

""Non-opioid substance use, specifically methamphetamine use at some SCS sites, increased substantially and numerous residents complained about aggressive and erratic behaviour of substance users leaving the sites. • Except for Edmonton, crime, as measured by police calls for service, generally increased in the immediate vicinity in contrast to areas beyond the immediate vicinity of the sites. Residents complained about the lack of response to calls for service by police. Site users and operators typically believed that the Section 56.1 exemption allowed for a nogo zone for police within the proximity of the site. Evidence suggested a level of “de-policing” near some sites. ""

Serious question: how long have you lived in the city?  The homeless/drug addicted/mentally ill zone used to be centered around 13th &amp; Locust, Love Park, Dillworth Plaza etc.   The city pushed all those people out of center city up to where they are now, and effectively abandoned them and told the homeowners to deal with it now.  This started when Rendell was mayor and now he is pushing it further in his retirement.   His ex-wife is a judge on the 3rd Circuit so I'm wondering how all this is going to play out.

&gt;U.S. District Judge Gerald A. McHugh granted the Justice Department’s request to issue a stay to his finding last year that such a site – where staff would provide medical supervision to people using drugs – would not violate federal law.

&gt;However, in doing so, the judge rejected arguments that allowing one to begin operation before the government had a chance to appeal would put the community and drug users at risk.

&gt;Instead, McHugh based his decision on the social and economic upheaval that has roiled the city for months. Now, he said, “is the wrong moment for another change to the status quo.”

&gt;“The nerves of citizens are frayed by fear and uncertainty,” the judge wrote. “Even if one assumes a flawless opening process, the operation of Safehouse [the nonprofit behind the supervised injection site plan] would represent a significant change in how the city responds to opioid abuse, and such change would be disruptive.”",1593044712.0,5,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,24-06-2020,17:25:12,,,,True,hfcj5s,1

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Supporters of reopening Philadelphia businesses will gather at City Hall on Friday, the day [parts of northern and western Pennsylvania will begin a phased lifting of shutdown restrictions](https://www.inquirer.com/news/coronavirus-covid-19-reopening-pa-yellow-counties-new-jersey-philadelphia-testing-increase-20200501.html), to rally against mass closures aimed at mitigating the spread of the coronavirus.  
&gt;  
&gt;Multiple groups are planning rallies set for the same time — some are small business owners in the city and workers who are sick of waiting for an unemployment check. Some also may be affiliated with the Philadelphia Proud Boys, a chapter of the self-described “Western chauvinist” organization that has been designated a hate group.  
&gt;  
&gt;All are demanding that Mayor Jim Kenney lay out a plan to ease social distancing restrictions in the city, though it isn’t clear if the mayor has the authority to do so. It was Gov. Tom Wolf who issued an order shutting down all but [“life-sustaining” businesses across the state](https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/inq/coronavirus-covid-19-what-is-open-pennsylvania-life-sustaining-business-20200403.html).  
&gt;  
&gt;“We hope Tom Wolf is watching,” Victor Della Barba, 39, of Drexel Hill, said, “because we’re angry at Harrisburg, too. But we’re just far away.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Della Barba and a few others — including his mother, Jody, well known in South Philadelphia civic and political circles — created the group ReOpen Philadelphia and are plotting a caravan of cars that will drive at noon Friday from Broad Street and Oregon Avenue to City Hall in an event they dubbed a “gridlock rally.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Victor Della Barba said the event is meant to be a Philadelphia version of protests that have taken place at state capitol buildings across the country, including Harrisburg in April, [when hundreds of protesters ](https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/spl/pennsylvania-anti-shutdown-rally-harrisburg-20200420.html)decried Wolf’s mass closures. Organizers weren’t sure how many people to expect at the Philly event.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jody Della Barba — who most recently helped plan [large protests against a Kenney-backed supervised injection site](https://www.inquirer.com/news/supervised-injection-site-safehouse-south-philadelphia-protest-20200228.html) in South Philly, which was ultimately [put on hold indefinitely](https://www.inquirer.com/news/supervised-injection-site-south-philadelphia-mcswain-appeal-rendell-20200227.html) — said she and her son are encouraging participants to stay in their cars.  
&gt;  
&gt;But they won’t be alone. Other Facebook groups demanding a relaxation of Philadelphia’s business restrictions have cropped up, including one planning an event called “Open Up Philly.” The event invitation says nothing about staying in cars and reads: “Bring flags, banners, signs, drinks and friends.”  
&gt;  
&gt;On Tuesday, word started circulating online that the event was organized in part by the Philadelphia Proud Boys, who didn’t respond to a request for comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;A person identified on social media as Jesus Tsirhc, one of the administrators of the Open Up Philly event, said via Facebook message that the group is “not the only group organizing a similar event Friday” and “we are not the only ones fed up with not being allowed to work.” He said some people would rally in cars; some on foot.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We’ve heard that a bunch of different groups are coming, including the Proud Boys,” he wrote. “We encourage everybody to join us Friday, especially patriots, and we’ve researched into the Proud Boys and checked their website and seen they are patriots.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The Southern Poverty Law Center has designated the Proud Boys, founded in 2016, as a hate group — a move [that prompted a lawsuit](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18211275/gavin-mcinnes-southern-poverty-law-center-defamation-lawsuit) — and the Anti-Defamation League [says the group](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18211275/gavin-mcinnes-southern-poverty-law-center-defamation-lawsuit) “represent\[s\] an unconventional strain of American right-wing extremism.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Victor Della Barba distanced himself from the Proud Boys, saying: “What are we going to do? Are we going to say ‘you guys can’t do it because we are?’ We’re not affiliated.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Kenney said Wednesday that data on the spread of the coronavirus, and not economic concerns, will dictate when the city’s stay-at-home order will be lifted. He pointed to rising case counts in Florida, which has begun relaxing social distancing measures, and blamed the rush to reopen on President Donald Trump.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We are not going to sacrifice people’s lives,"" Kenney said in a virtual news conference. ""There’s no such thing as collateral lives. They’re all human beings. They’re all part of our country, state, and city, and we’re not going to sacrifice anybody intentionally.”  
&gt;  
&gt;He added that whether he has the authority to supersede the governor’s order on business closures doesn’t matter, because the city is working in tandem with leaders in Harrisburg and the suburbs.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We are in constant contact with them, with the governor’s office, on a regional basis, so that we’re all walking in the same direction,” he said.",1588816280.0,5,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,06-05-2020,18:51:20,,,,True,gexh65,1

SAFEHOUSE: A new pair of SNEAKS


By Patty-Pat Kozlowski

The following is a published newspaper report from a community meeting in Philadelphia:

Benitez and Goldfein apologized to the residents for the way they found out about the safe injection site.

“Many of you are hearing rumors about it for the first time, and we apologize for that,” Jose Benitez said. “That wasn’t the intent, and we hope to keep these kinds of conversations going on.”

“It was never our intention that you would hear about this through the media,” Goldfein said. “We had always hoped that there would be a greater public conversation, and so I understand why you’re angry and we apologize. It was not our intention.”

Does the above exchange between Ronda Goldfein and Jose Benitz, the vice president and president of SafeHouse, sound familiar?

Wasn’t that what they just said to furious South Philly residents last week when the community found out SafeHouse was opening up a Safe Injection Site for heroin addicts at Broad and McKean?

It seems history is repeating itself and once again Safehouse is whizzing on the legs of Philadelphia residents and telling them its only rain. (Here! Enjoy a SafeHouse umbrella, it comes with ten clean hypodermic needles!)

Because the above exchange, which seems to be on repeat loop from SafeHouse, was actually from almost a year ago.

The above exchange was the lip service given to the residents of Harrowgate, Kenisngton, Juaniata and Port Richmond in April of 2019 when those community members found out, via the media and neighborhood grapevine that Safehouse was signing a lease for $1 a year to open up the first safe injection site in the United States on the 1800 block of Hilton Street in Kensington.

Those quotes from SafeHouse board members were part of a story headlined, “Elected officials, residents rail against possibility of Kensington-area safe injection site at Harrowgate meeting”, written by Tom Beck and published in the Star Community Newspaper, a weekly newspaper that covers the Philly riverwards.

Over a hundred angry residents, many feeling that they were back-doored and hoodwinked, packed into the Heitzman Recreation Center to lambast SafeHouse and the City of Philadelphia for not just trying to open a legal heroin injection site in their area but moreso about the covert and SNEAKY way they were doing it.

Once the information was leaked out that SafeHouse was planning on signing a lease on a Hilton Street property, Shannon Farrell-Pakstis’ phone rang. It was Goldfein.

. According to a statement published in the Juniata Times, another small community newspaper, Shannon Farrell Pakstis, President of the Harrowgate Civic Association (HCA), received a call from Safehouse Vice President Ronda Goldfein, alerting her of the decision. Farrell said that Goldfein told her that she’s not asking for her permission, but just being transparent in letting her know that they are moving forward with negotiating a lease.

The backlash and opposition was so overwhelming at SafeHouse’s sneaky smoke and mirror assault on community engagement in 2019 that Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney put the brakes on the project by stating, “Valid public safety concerns have been raised by the community in and around Kensington, and I have informed Safehouse that those safety concerns must be addressed before the establishment of an OPS (overdose prevention site).

But it seems that the can of whoop ass that Harrowgate/Kensington/Port Richmond opened up on SafeHouse because of their sneakiness did not stop them for trying the same thing in South Philly a year later in 2020.

Without any community input, engagement or even the high and mighty transparency that Goldfein tardily bestowed onto the riverwards in 2019, SafeHouse began acquiring a lease agreement for a property at Broad and McKean Streets. SafeHouse, with former governor and mayor Ed Rendell now as their head leg whizzer, once again apologized and said it was not their intention to ignore the community and create mistrust.

What they were really saying was, “It was not our intention to get caught again, and for that we apologize.”

Did SafeHouse really think they were going to scam South Philly because their crackerjack plan didn’t work in Kensington? Did they think that just because a legal opinion swayed their way, that South Philadelphians would just do the Phillly shrug? Have they seen the parking in the middle of south Broad Street? You don’t tell South Philly what to do. And God forbid they catch you sneaking around.

But just like Shannon Farrell Pakstis was tipped off in Harrowgate, Jody Della Barba was tipped off in South Philadelphia. It was an anonymous source that told the community activist about SafeHouse signing a lease at Constitution Plaza, the old St. Agnes Medical Center with the plans to open a safe injection site.

What happened next was pure karma.

Della Barba and her neighbors contacted all of the tenants located in the Constitutional Plaza building and the surrounding businesses at Broad and McKean about the proposed safe injection site. NONE of them knew about it. They contacted their city council people-Squilla and Johnson. They didn’t even know the location. The residents then got a hold of the building’s owner, Jim Atlass and did the full court press. Their actions and a call to arms exploded on Facebook.

SafeHouse didn’t know what hit em’.

After a dynamite filled press conference at Rendell’s office in the Bellevue, called so quickly and hastily that even Safehouse’s president Benitez was still on vacation and absent, everything seemed to implode. South Philly resident Leighanne Savloff ripped into Rendell like a Wawa hoagie, yelling at him-“Look at me Mr. Rendell, because you are a sneak! You blindsided us!”

Can you guess what SafeHouse replied? Why, they just started to sing their greatest hits:

We apologize.

It was not our intentions.

We want to be transparent with the community.

Rendell, the former Mayor of Philadelphia that could sell a tombstone to the dead, went on talk radio and said it was his fault and his call not to alert the community and he was sorry and won’t make that mistake again.

And we are to believe that one of our most popular mayors, a guy who jumped in rec pools, always had hoagie oil on his tie and bled Eagles green, did not know to inform the people of South Philly that a safe injection site was opening up in their backyard. I guess after a half century in public service, it slipped his mind.

Lie to me once, shame on you, lie to me twice, shame on me.

What’s the next neighborhood in Philadelphia that SafeHouse will sneak into?

They have 20 sites planned. Mayfair? Swampoodle? Point Breeze? Pennsport? Bridesburg? Lawncrest? Manyunk? Tacony? Frankford? North Broad? Roxborough? Fishtown? West Oak Lane?

Pay attention to your neighborhood grapevine and have your fellow Philadelphians’ back because it is not Safehouse’s intentions to tell you…..until they get caught. Again.",1583264516.0,1,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,03-03-2020,11:41:56,,,1583264850.0,False,fck37v,1

1. Safehouse: “We’re opening a Safe Injection Site in your neighborhood! We’re saving lives! No one had ever died inside a Safe Injection Site!

Neighbors:”What about what happens outside? The drug dealing, the guns, the prostitution, the sanitation and health issues of allowing people to sleep and defecate on the sidewalk?

Safehouse: “Security is not out responsibility. Talk to the Police!

2. Police: We can’t arrest our way out of this problem! Besides, the DA is not prosecuting. Talk to the DA!

3. DA: The police should never have said that. Talk to their boss. Talk to the Mayor!

4. Mayor: We fires the police commissioner and deputy commissioner. We will have a comprehensive community safety plan before a Safe Injection Site opens. Just wait!

5. Community waits 3 months. “Safety Plan” says the city will ensure drug users respect the community and the police will protect the users from neighborhood protestors.

6. Neighbor: “Huh?”

7. Safehouse: “We open next week!” 

***

Also see: Neighbors collect 15,000 signatures against the site. Elect city council members who are against the site. Six neighborhood associations sign letters opposing site.

Drexel University School of Public Health, with ties to Safehouse, commissions a clandestine “survey” of “residents” that says 90% of neighbors support the site.

Neighbors: “Huh?”

Rendell: “The people have spoken! The neighbors overwhelmingly support the site! We’re submitting this survey in Federal Court as irrefutable evidence!

Inquirer: Anything Rendell says is true. My wife, who is on the board of Safehouse, told me that. Print it!

SafeHouse dumped this shit on our step.  The community got mad, City Council got mad.  SafeHouse then allegedly ""hit the pause button,"" and the Constitution pulled the lease.  

Here's what really happened--the community got up in arms, the tenants in Constitution probably said ""I don't want my business next to an SIS, let's call our landlord, and Constitution pulled the lease because they didn't want to lose their existing business and piss off the local customer base they have.  SafeHouse has not identified any other site they want to open yet.

So why choose to protest in front of the building that pulled the lease?  It makes no sense. If you want to complain and actually get heard, go to center city. Don't just have some thrown together bullshit hangout and block off parts of McKean and Passyunk.  It's just rude to everyone else around here who doesn't want to protest or doesn't want a protest on their block.  What really concerned me was seeing one of the protesters assault someone walking their dog down the 1500 block of Passyunk.  Even without the necessary permits, these people have the right to protest, but don't have the right to assault people who live around here.

So yeah I'm totally ""skipping my therapist appointments"" dude.  Why don't you go arrange a picket in front of Ronda Goldfein's house like you recommended in your previous posts in the megathread?

*Q: What safety and security protocols will exist at Safehouse for both users and the community?*

*A: Safehouse will provide appropriate security for its facilities and immediate surroundings. All participants will be expected to comply with rules to ensure the safety of participants, employees, volunteers, and the public. Safehouse is developing detailed policies and procedures, which it will post in a conspicuous place on location and on its website.*

They don't even have fucking formal safety procedures in place but fuck it, let's open next week.

Can anyone answer these questions:

Will the drug users be kept there for the duration of their high or released after injection?

If Safehouse tests a user's drugs and finds levels of fentanyl that would make an OD likely, would they let the user inject and/or return the drugs to the user or confiscate and dispose of them?",1582828469.0,3,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,27-02-2020,10:34:29,,,,False,fa6g7l,1

101,fix92po,,fa6g7l,yu52w,,comment,SweetJibbaJams,"Boy do I have so many mixed feelings about this. I live in Kensington, get on the El at K&amp;A to commute to work, so in some ways I am relieved this isn't happening in my neighborhood (yet), but it is a clear harbinger of what is to come. I've gone back and forth about supporting the SIS, and I think ultimately it *could* be a good thing, but they way that the city is going about it is going to ruin any potential it has. 

Since no one has gathered any of the data surrounding it, I will take a stab at it but before I do, I feel like I should mention something else that hasn't been said yet - If you are a South Philly resident and supported an SIS in Kensington and are up in arms now that it is in your own neighborhood, all I have to say is screw you too.

Now that I've got that out of my system - let's try to take an actual look at this situation. Feel free to let me know if there is any additional data/reports I can include.

Opioid deaths -

Regardless of where you stand on SIS, [there is undeniably a crisis in Philadelphia.](https://www.phila.gov/programs/combating-the-opioid-epidemic/reports-and-data/opioid-misuse-and-overdose-data/) In 2018 there were a total of 1,116 deaths, and it appears that 2019 is going to be around the same amount. [BC had a very similar increase/rate](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/life-events/death/coroners-service/statistical-reports). Since we are comparing the two cities, its good to know that at least they are comparable, despite the unfortunate reality behind the data. I have not been able to find out what led to the drop in BC's 2019 numbers yet.

SIS effectiveness - 

Here is where everything gets muddy. I think that we can with some certainty say that SIS do provide some measure of harm reduction. [From the Safehouse resource page](https://dbhids.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/OTF_LarsonS_PHLReportOnSCF_Dec2017.pdf) and the previous coroners data report we can see that in areas surrounding the injection sites there is a noticeable decrease in infection and what is claimed to be a 35% decrease in OD deaths. **HOWEVER** that number is only between 2004-2008, which seems strange for a paper written in 2017 where there is plenty of data available, and omits the time period where there was an increase in ODs due to Fentanyl. It is also worth noting that the proposed site in South Philly is only going to be open for 5 days a week, between the hours of 10am-2pm. Is that really expected to utilize the harm reduction benefits of a SIS effectively? *Opinion - It is hard to trust the numbers being provided here. We can see that BC had a similar increase in Opioid deaths relating to Fentanyl being introduced to the drug supply, so why exclude that time period? I would be interested to see what else can be provided here. Additionally, limited hours of operation in no way will be effective.*

Crime reduction/impact - 

If SIS effectiveness was a murky pond, this is probably the La Brea Tar Pits. [The Safehouse source] (https://www.safehousephilly.org/resources/the-science#sdnfootnote7) was either behind a paywall, or wanted access to all my google contacts, so I wasn't about to do either of those. It seems like most sources however state that there was no impact, positive or negative on crime. A paper citing numbers however would be nice if anyone can track one down. We do have, however, [google maps](https://imgur.com/a/ddbAMCp). *Opinion - I think the lack of positive impact is notable, because shouldn't we be striving to improve the areas as a whole? To say there isn't a negative impact is disingenuous when we are just saying the increase in crime is from outside sources and SIS dont make a significant enough impact to stem the demand for opioids*

Community Input - 

I hope I can find some info on how Vancouver handled the introduction of the SIS in their communities, because I can't imagine it was bungled nearly as badly as Philadelphia. I was certain that Kensington was going to get a site rammed down their throat after months of pushback, so needless to say I was stunned when South Philly was selected as the first location, to be opened *next week*. As far as I am aware, that location had not been mentioned whatsoever in any media appearance or publication. I cannot imagine a worse possible methodology there than to pull a bait and switch. To quote [the woman at the press conference](https://www.fox29.com/video/658873), they are a bunch of sneaks. 

All this to say - if the sources that Safehouse cite are saying "" as we describe in this document, the alarming increase of
nonfatal and fatal overdose rates, as well as the trends in fentanyl presence in Philadelphia,
indicates that several strategies need to be leveraged to address the ongoing crisis"" and we aren't providing a comprehensive plan to address the crisis, it is hard to consider their application as little more than political pandering at the expense of residents. I think most people are in favor of harm reduction and improving quality of life for addicts in a humane manner, but they way that Safehouse and the City of Philadelphia are going about this is frankly shameful. I will probably keep editing this comment with more info as I come across it as well, but I hope this helps people come to something of an informed opinion.",1582815509.0,1,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,27-02-2020,06:58:29,,,,False,fa6g7l,1

The questions you posed in the bullets immediately following that statement would have been unanswerable at the time. Your argument was nonsensical at the time, even if it became true in the four months since. 

Put explicitly, you're conflating the two ideas: 

&gt;I think it would be premature to propose a Supervised Injection Site without something resembling a plan for how to deal with security.

and

&gt;I suspect the organization has a lot of ideas about what they want to do but are intentionally withholding as much as possible from the public so it is easier for them to move forward.

Not right away, anyway.  They're smarter than that.  Here's what's going to happen:

The place will open.  Initially, there will be a commotion.  But then things will settle down.  And, quietly, the DEA will gather evidence.  They'll recruit informants, conduct covert surveillance,  etc.

Then, eventually, there will be a trigger event there.  Someone will overdose, experience an uncontrollable bleed or air embolism, etc. Or maybe someone will use there, then go use somewhere else, and die.  Maybe the family of the deceased will file a lawsuit and name the facility and all working there as defendants.

Regardless of the trigger, that's when the DEA will swoop in with everything they've collected.  Arrests? That's the least of what people participating in this have to worry about.

Medical personnel will lose their licenses (and day jobs).  Even if they don't, once their names become public, no malpractice insurance carrier will cover them.

What I mean to say is their philosophy is “help”-without judgements. There’s no room in their minds for a coupling of the safehouse and treatment regimes. Except for providing “information”.

Actually enforcing the law, and detaining individuals engaged in public intoxication, camping in the street, shitting in the sidewalk, etc, and using drug courts to sentence these individuals to 6 months of MANDATORY VIVITROL TREATMENT is a brilliant idea. No such charge would be a part of their criminal record, nothing like that. If they don’t comply, it’s public service cleanup, (paid). If they refuse, it’s public service sentencing withou remaining on their record. If they don’t compl wit that, rinse and repeat the entire process.

March 10: Safehouse pretends to not know where a site may go. Could be anywhere, right?

2 weeks later - March 21: Rendell announces to the CATO Institute in Washington, DC that [Safehouse will sign a lease for 1800 Hilton Street.](https://whyy.org/articles/rendell-safehouse-offered-building-for-injection-site-for-1-by-developer-whose-son-died-of-an-overdose/)  Wow that was fast!

Safehouse board member Rendell tells CATO that Hilton Street is ""on the border of Kensington"" (its 1/2 block from K&amp;A, Ed.  Were you ever here when you were mayor?)

Even during the crack epidemic  of the '80s it wasn't this bad.  Before that, the homeless/mentally ill/addicted congregated at The Walnut-Locust subway stop, Dillworth Plaza, Love Park and 13th &amp; Spruce.  The city put a kibosh on that and sent them packing north. When I was a kid in the '80, cops enforced loitering and curfew laws and you would be arrested if you were out past 10 pm.  Now a kid sticks a needle full of fentanyl in his neck on the El and the cops can't do anything.

There are five hospitals within two miles of this Hilton Street site, why the SIS can't go near one of them has not been answered.  Is the city or commonwealth going to open more beds to transition these people to treatment, or just put them back on the Avenue after each day's shift?  Crickets.

Since Vancouver where this site is located is a shithole still after almost 20 years, I think it's ""safe"" to say that you agreeing with the ""SAFEHOUSE"" idea means you're ready to write parts of Kensington off for an indefinite period into the future, backed up with your claim to support ""buyouts"" of homeowners with what would have to be taxpayer money, effectively creating a real life hamsterdam.  

Therefore I must conclude that you hold the rights of addicts and the shitbird flock that feeds on them above the rights of actual working persons who are not addicts and otherwise live in the area, and by extension, our children. 


I have a different opinion, one that is well known on this sub. You have refuted my ideas with some studies that take into account ""saving lives"", and that my ideas would ""cost too much"", to which I have said ""bullshit"", as this is a public health emergency, and should be attacked from all sides with a comprehensive law enforcement plan, a mandatory treatment program, and immediate cleanup and removal of all encampments, along with L&amp;I aggressively enforcing PM codes.",1539975681.0,1,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,19-10-2018,12:01:21,,,,False,9pj6wc,1

If the Safehouse board had a legal interpretation from their lawyers that said there's no wiggle room in the law and they were clearly committing a felony to open an SIS, and then they too material steps to open it, then *maybe*. But even then, for something like this that's never even been prosecuted before, it'd be absurd to argue there's a conspiracy when legitimate alternative legal interpretations exist.
