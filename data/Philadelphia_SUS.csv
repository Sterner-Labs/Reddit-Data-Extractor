It's probably something you *could* do but in there's always the issue of trusting who you're donating to and some guy representing ""the small businesses in Philly"" might be a little sus. might be easier/more trust worthy to coordinate some sort of cleanup or non monetary help. Just gonna copy and paste my comment from earlier here too cause I think it's relevant: 

If you want to help small businesses I’d reach out on social media in a DM to see what you can do. Maybe they need people to help clean/repair damage or you can donate private/directly. I doubt any of these places would post some sort of GoFundMe type donation right now. As much as some places might need it, it might need be the best PR move right now unfortunately. I could easily see backlas from it.",1591133009,3,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,02-06-2020,14:23:29,,,,False,gv4l9x,1

9,dd5idob,,dd5hk0h,50o77,Kinoblau,comment,WheresRet,"&gt; Yeah, but your understanding of that logic is non-existent, that's not the way any of that works. In fact, your understanding of the world is wild sus and kind of stupid.

How so? 


&gt; I cannot bike to work as it is 50 miles away from where I live, there are no jobs for what I do close to where I live, I cannot move because I do not have the funds, I do not have the money for an electric car. You're an idiot.

Let's break this down.

1) **""There are no jobs for what I do close to where I live""**. Then change what you do?

2) **""I cannot move because I do not have the funds""** Get a second job, I am guessing you do not own your house so you cannot sell it. When your lease ends, move to where your job is?

3) **""I do not have the money for an electric car""** you can sell your current car and rent and electric car, or buy an electric moped. 


You seem to be making a lot of excuses.",1485886061,4,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,31-01-2017,10:07:41,,,,,5r8o20,1

People aren't free of encumbrances you dunce. The world is not frictionless, people can't just do things like ""buy an electric car"" or ""move"" and if you think they can you either haven't entered the real world yet, or you've never had to face any adversity before.",1485885175,-3,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,31-01-2017,09:52:55,,,,,5r8o20,1
