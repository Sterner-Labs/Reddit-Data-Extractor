4,co40ofg,,co3y3wv,3kax9,susinpgh,comment,WiseCynic,"&gt; I have to wonder if there are other factors (waste, graft, mismanagement) that might also need to be addressed in Penn DOT.

PennDOT's problems with those things, even if eliminated completely, aren't going to eliminate the gas tax.  And if it were run perfectly, the gas tax wouldn't come down.  They'd just find more things to spend the money on.  Things like replacing bridges that are falling apart, filling more pot holes, plowing and salting more roads, etc.

There is more waste, fraud, and corruption in the oil companies than there is in PennDOT.  They spend more money every year lobbying congress than PennDOT's annual budget.  Hell, they get more in something called ""corporate welfare"" every year than PennDOT spends in 3 years.  It's billions of taxpayer dollars!

A few extra cents in gas tax?  A drop in the bucket that stays within PA instead of being put in offshore accounts by ExxonMobile and BP.

Nope.  No pain here, sus.  The more gas you buy, the more you put toward keeping the roads in good condition that you're obviously using frequently.  I have no problem with our gas tax.  If they want to crank another nickel a gallon into it, I'll be all for it - IFF they can show that it will be spent wisely on actual infrastructure and not on shrimp lunches for the admins.
