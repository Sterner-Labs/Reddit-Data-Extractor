3,fix5h6b,4758x3yf,fiwivmm,,,comment,,"Not wanting a place for drug users to congregate in you neighborhood has nothing to do with being conservative vs. liberal. It's crazy how some people act like every human decision can fit comfortably on a four panel political compass meme. 

This isn't a political issue, it's a health and safety issue. You cannot in good faith say that the neighborhood will be safer with this. Every example has shown the opposite. Just because something is healthier for drug users doesn't mean it's healthier for the people who already live there. Every addiction treatment methodology says not to enable (and/or become co-dependent with, as this non-profit has) addicts.",1582813125.0,6,False,2qn7a,,,,0,,,,,,27-02-2020,06:18:45,,,1582813604.0,False,f9zcin,1
