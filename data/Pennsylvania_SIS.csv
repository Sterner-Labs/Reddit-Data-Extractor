Never claimed not to be invested. I'm actually putting effort into my responses. It's ok if you don't. You asked questions, I answered them. You're just hell bent on proving me wrong because I think the police have too much military equipment but they still can't beat the feds.  Hard to disagree with someone you agree with.",1595533711,1,False,2qn7a,,,,0,,,,,,23-07-2020,12:48:31,,,,False,hvxnnf,1
2,fvjcnua,,fvb3gjl,gbzqf,Stlr_Mn,comment,TheObsoleteMan6261,"That's not necessarily the case. My sis is a psychical therapist. They were ordered to stop taking thier regular patients. They instead had hospice patients sent to thier facility and coronavirus patients. 

You tell me what's gonna happen to the hospice patients (mind you they were already previously on hospice, meaning beyond a doubt would've died with the year). The short time they have left is made even less and they are guaranteed a covid19 positive death. 

They were forced to do it, they had no choice in the matter. They were not and STILL are not to this day allowed to operate as a physical therapy facility... 

That's not sending people back to thier homes. That's intentionally orchestrating a situation where its guarenteed you are shortening peoples lives and inflating the death count... 

This is not okay at all. The same thing in the nursing homes it's not just people who came from the nursing home (which is still wrong) it's people who weren't their to begin with. In an attempt to free up hospitals... well the hospitals aren't overrun. Yet they still enforce this.

It is murder plain and simple, if you disagree then we differ on a moral and ethical level greatly. I will never excuse this atrocity away. With a weak excuse such as oh they lived thier anyway a) that is NOT always the case. B) regardless you still put those not exposed at risk.   ITS NOT OKAY, IT WILL NEVER BE OKAY. 

All of the deaths directly because of this are killing more people than those in the nursing home, out patient facilities etc. Its killing people by continuing to revoke thier means to life, making access to medical care outside of coronavirus impossible, or very difficult. Its scaring people into dying in thier homes when they could have been saved because they are too scared to even seek medical care. 

It's disgusting, we should be protecting the most vulnerable not straight up murdering them...",1592746934,1,False,2qn7a,,,,0,,,,,,21-06-2020,06:42:14,,,,False,hbjbjv,1
