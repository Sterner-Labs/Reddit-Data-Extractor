73,dfdqyhl,,61dquo,159ufs,,comment,76win76ers,"I've been getting downvoted for not liking Ball. He is a great passer but we need someone effective offensively off ball with the ability to guard the 1. His offense is hit or miss, he can't create space on his own, and his defense is sus. Just a bad fit. I'm all aboard Monk though. That leap when he bit on that fake at the end of the game was absurd. Guy flies, distributes, and has crazy range.",1490415335.0,20,False,2scmr,,,,0,,,,,,24-03-2017,21:15:35,,,,,61dquo,1

76,dckop2l,,5omqy8,,,comment,sinokristi,"I want Monk b/c the guy can flat out shoot and score at the 2 spot. His scoring and 3 point abilities are well-documented, but he also shoots 85% from the line which I like to take as an indicator of his actual form and ability to translate into the NBA. Imagine him camping on that 3 point line with all the attention being drawn to Simmons and Embiid? Yeah, his D is sus but so is the D of so many other players. He seems athletic and willing enough to get better at it, plus he will be on a great defensive team with the Sixers and will pick up. Hope we take him that second lotto pick and get one of the 3 top PG/s (DSJ, Ball, Fultz) with the better lotto pick.",1484718363.0,2,False,2scmr,,,,0,,,,,,17-01-2017,21:46:03,,,,,5omqy8,1
