At least Noel hasn't KO'd anybody/ pulled some GTA shit yet lol.

When I say Rich is just like Jerami, I mean he wants to Dunk the ball every possession. Very interested to know if he could learn to play the 3.

I explained the Arch thing above, definitely thinking with my heart not my head.

Robert Covington is a huge disappointment. He average 12.8 per game on a team he easily should have be averaging 20 on. He has a phobia of dunking the basketball and he shot selection when it comes to threes is as good as Canaan's. When he's swishing that's great, but when he misses... The guys just way to inconsisitent for my tastes and in a league ruled by SF's like KD and Lebron he just seems to fall short. I mean he can't even really play the 4 if we need him to.

For the draft, no matter who we pick we'll be alright is what I was alluding to. Not that it doesn't matter.

Saric could definitely play 3 or 4 that guy can move!",1460741143,-1,False,2scmr,,,,0,,,,,,15-04-2016,10:25:43,,,,,4ewnpo,1
