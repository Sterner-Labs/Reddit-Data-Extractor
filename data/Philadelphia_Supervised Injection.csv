For anyone questioning the effectiveness of supervised injection sites, please read this study done in 2014 which cites 44 different medical articles:
http://www.ohtn.on.ca/Pages/Knowledge-Exchange/Rapid-Responses/Documents/RR83-Supervised-Injection-Effectiveness.pdf

**Some of the key findings:**

The use of supervised injection services can lead to reductions in injecting behaviour and an increase in the number of clients accessing addiction treatment services.
**And**
Overdose morbidity and mortality are reduced when clients inject at supervised injection sites.
Worried about safety?
Supervised injection sites do not lead to any significant disruptions in public order or safety in the neighbourhoods where they are located.

**TL:DR** - supervised injection sites improve public health, reduce overdose deaths, and have no negative affect on public safety.",1487603061,114,False,t5_2qh24,Contact Kenney's Opioid Task Force and tell them you support supervised injection sites in North Philadelphia to curb the amount of overdose-related deaths in this city.,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/5v4z6a/contact_kenneys_opioid_task_force_and_tell_them/,,158,False,,1489569634,philadelphia,,20-02-2017,07:04:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/5v4z6a/contact_kenneys_opioid_task_force_and_tell_them/,,1487623366.0,,,1

The current flat wage tax is bananas, we should have progressive municipal personal income taxes and halve or end the property tax abatement. We have a deeply inefficient system of revenue generation and collection, and the region has the financial wherewithal to do better things if we tap into it properly.

2. End Councilmanic Prerogative. So much good policy gets stonewalled because of this petty bullshit.

3. Slash the PPD's budget to better fund municipal &amp; social services. Police have a definite role to play in keeping our home safe and responding to crime, so we should let them do that rather than asking them to also be social workers and allowing things like roadwork and garbage collection to atrophy.

4. Safe injection sites, supervised by trained employees who can be paid for with some of that redistributed PPD money. The fact that this hasn't happened yet really just seems like the worst kind of NIMBYism to me, but in this fantasy world where I'm the mayor I'm also assuming I can just make it happen.

5. Require big companies with Philadelphia footprints to establish offices in and hire qualified candidates from economically depressed neighborhoods. I'm not going to say that this would solve the city's economic problems overnight, but Comcast doesn't really reinvest in the community in meaningful ways when their employees live on the Main Line.

“The government assembled a panel last summer to examine how supervised consumption sites affect community members, specifically business owners. The panel’s March 2020 report noted complaints about needle debris and social disorder surrounding the facilities.

But a damning financial audit released in July was the final nail in the coffin for ARCHES.

The audit found more than $1.6 million of government funding was unaccounted for, while a senior executive’s compensation of $342,943 was more than four times what its grant allocation permitted, and $13,000 of interest from ARCHES bank accounts funded parties, staff retreats, gift cards, and entertainment.”

The site in Canada that Kenney spoke with has done a masterful job of transforming the information of their statistics to help swindle people into believing it, but it's a false narrative.

In fact, in Montreal they now have MORE overdose deaths than they did 15 years ago. If this concept worked in Philly, we would have a lot less syringe drug use, and AIDS, given Rendell already did ""Prevention Point"" in 90's.

But Philly remains the HIGHEST opioid overdose death city in the nation, and we have 5x the national average of AIDS cases. It was a nice theory 30 years ago, but has proven disastrous every single time. A complete failure.

Also, cannabis has legal distribution across the nation, so it makes sense to allow its consumption recreationally in public spaces. Heroin, oxycontin (not prescribed), and other injected narcotics are still schedule 1 so their use shouldn't be enabled.

These sites collect samples from their ""clients,"" which are sent to labs for testing, which is a known insurance scam even Jon Oliver reported on it. They call piss ""liquid gold"" in those kinds of environments. No telling who owns the right to any DNA or lineage testing they do, too.

In the piece Krasner stated that “ In Canada, where OPS is legal, harm reduction workers reported seeing an [immediate spike in overdoses](https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2020/04/16/citys-busiest-supervised-injection-site-to-reopen-after-month-long-closure-over-covid-19.html) when some OPS were temporarily closed in the name of social distancing.”

That seems to be at least one case study that Krasner is using to support his opinion. Most of the responses on reddit to the article seem to be the lowest form of an argument (name-calling).

That pretty well describes the neighborhood, does it not? 

Now think about what the inclusion of a supervised injection site means: reduced overdosing in the streets. Reduced numbers of addicts in the streets, since they'll be at the site. A stronger police presence at and around the site, and a population less afraid of being arrested, due to what amounts to a public announcement that using drugs at the site will go unpunished. Reduced selling of drugs, reduced crime, and reduced associated violence due to the increased police presence. Increased presence of social service help at the site with the end goal of fewer addicts and more recovered addicts. Reduced drugs in the neighborhood around the site as users go to the site instead of your front step.

We can argue all we want about the root cause of addiction, and whether the blame lies on the users or the system--but from either side of the political spectrum, the solution is clear: get these people off drugs.

That's a policy that she was particularly involved with forming and executing.

No doubt, but again, the lawsuit lead to clarification of an otherwise vague law.  You and others try to paint this picture of Grossman stealing houses from innocent people to fund lavish vacations to Iceland (or some other scandalous thing).

&gt; The beginning of the ""Preponderance of evidence"" standard for forfeiture was in 2005. Which was when Beth Grossman headed that office (2003-2015). So... as far as her predecessor: Not really.

&gt; https://www.aclupa.org/files/3214/3326/0426/Guilty_Property_Report_-_FINAL.pdf

Your link strengthens and reaffirms all the points I've made, so thank you for sharing it:

&gt; Every year, Pennsylvania law enforcement agencies take roughly $14 million in cash,
&gt; cars, and homes from property owners and never give it back.1 **These confiscations are
&gt; authorized by state civil asset forfeiture laws** — powerful legal tools that let police and
&gt; prosecutors seize and keep property that they claim was connected to a crime.2

[..]

&gt; **Under state civil forfeiture laws, all the revenue generated from forfeiture goes directly to law
&gt; enforcement and can even be distributed to police and prosecutors as bonuses.**5 As a result,
&gt; the agencies making enforcement decisions have a strong financial incentive to pursue as
&gt; many forfeitures as possible. In Philadelphia, the district attorney’s share of forfeiture proceeds
&gt; is roughly $2.2 million — or 7.3% of its appropriated budget.6 **Assuming forfeiture proceeds are
&gt; split between prosecutors and police in a similar ratio across the state, DA’s offices in other
&gt; counties aren’t far behind.** In fact, in four out of the next ten most populous counties, the DA
&gt; would receive the equivalent of about 5% of its budget in forfeiture proceeds.7

[..]

&gt; Worrying evidence suggests that the profits and sweeping powers offered by civil forfeiture
&gt; have distorted a tool originally targeted at cartels and drug kingpins.9 An article in the
&gt; Philadelphia City Paper in 2012 indicated that Philadelphia prosecutors regularly forfeit sums
&gt; as small as $100 and that people trying to get their property back sometimes had to attend
&gt; upwards of ten court dates just to reach a hearing before a judge.10 Other media accounts
&gt; chronicled the human toll of civil forfeiture. In one, a Philadelphia grandmother faced losing her
&gt; home because a grandson sold a small amount of drugs out of it.11 In another, a Lancaster
&gt; mother had $300 seized from her purse when her son was arrested on narcotics charges.12
&gt; 
&gt; **Law enforcement argues that stories like these are outliers and that the vast majority of
&gt; forfeitures target criminals and their ill-gotten gains.**

[..]

&gt; Both in Philadelphia and across the
&gt; nation, data on **the percentage of people
&gt; who lose property to civil forfeitures without
&gt; ever being found guilty of a crime is scant.**

&gt; One Philadelphia reporter conservatively
&gt; estimated the yearly income from these
&gt; innocent owner forfeitures in the hundreds of
&gt; thousands of dollars.40 After analyzing a
&gt; randomized sample of over 300 cash cases
&gt; from 2011 to 2013 , however, our
&gt; investigation **revealed that even that startling
&gt; estimate is low.** 

[..]

&gt;  Indeed, while our investigation was limited
&gt; to Philadelphia County, **its findings suggest the
&gt; broader dangers inherent to a law rooted in a
&gt; basic contradiction: that the government can
&gt; forfeit property connected to a crime without
&gt; proving that the owner is guilty.**


[..]

&gt; **Sensible reform wouldn’t eliminate forfeiture as a
&gt; crime-fighting tool. Rather, it would replace the
&gt; fiction that property is guilty with the truth that
&gt; only people commit crimes**. This fundamental
&gt; shift — from civil forfeiture to what is termed
&gt; “criminal forfeiture” — would mean that forfeiture
&gt; would occur as part of the underlying criminal
&gt; case and only after the property owner is
&gt; convicted. In that way, **every person facing
&gt; forfeiture would receive the full range of
&gt; protections our founding fathers intended** for
&gt; people accused of crimes. Meaningful reform
&gt; would also ensure forfeiture enforcement was democratically accountable by channeling the
&gt; proceeds from forfeiture into a general county or state fund that would be distributed through
&gt; the normal budgeting process, instead of directly into the coffers of law enforcement as an
&gt; off-budget revenue stream with no political oversight. Police and prosecutors would then be
&gt; required to fund forfeiture enforcement in the same way they fund every other type of
&gt; enforcement activity: by making requests through the regular budgeting process.

Please read the portions I've highlighted as important.

&gt; Beth Grossman's signature appeared on nearly all claims against cash in Philadelphia between 2003 and 2015.

From your source:

&gt; the DA’s office files the same boilerplate petition in every cash case


and since you pointed out what she said in defense of herself here:

&gt; ""I reviewed every case, I did not abuse the law."" Which means she believes, in spite of what the courts have said, that she was right.

I'd like to point you right back to your own source:

&gt; Both in Philadelphia and across the
&gt; nation, data on **the percentage of people
&gt; who lose property to civil forfeitures without
&gt; ever being found guilty of a crime is scant.**

and on Safe-Injection sites:

&gt; Because when it was tried in Vancouver it drastically increased treatment referrals, which would reduce the number of junkies on the street (And thus junkie committed crimes).

Let's look at some real statistics because this is an area I disagree with both DA candidates on:

&gt; Vancouver’s Insite supervised injection center opened in 2003 and has seen nearly 3.5 million visits since then. Here are statistics for use in 2015:

&gt; • 263,713 visits by 6,532 individuals
&gt; 
&gt; • Average 722 visits per day
&gt; 
&gt; • 768 overdoses
&gt; 
&gt; • 5,368 referrals to social and health services
&gt; 
&gt; • 464 referrals to Onsite detox center
&gt; 
&gt; • 262 completed drug treatment.
&gt;
&gt;Vancouver Coastal Health

So of the 6,532 individuals only 262 completed drug treatment.  Fairly low number of ""success stories"" considering the high cost of handling an average of 722 visits per day.

Furthermore neither DA candidate has stated there would be any kind of push to get junkies into treatment and as other countries have found, safe-injection sites alone do not solve the problem of widespread opioid abuse.",1509989967,-1,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,06-11-2017,09:39:27,,,,,7b5hfz,1

The problem is this isn't Europe and those services largely don't exist for people without money here.

Safe injection sites are a nice virtue-signal, but they're not going to do anything to combat the problem proper, and any money for funding them needs to instead be spent on establishing the underlying services that make them so effective in other models.

__Supervised Consumption Facilities and Safe Injection Facilities__



1. Supervised Injection Facilities (SIFs), Sanitary Consumption Facilities (SCFs), and Drug Consumption Rooms (DCRs)
""Drug consumption rooms are professionally supervised healthcare facilities where drug users can consume drugs in safer conditions. They seek to attract hard-to-reach populations of drug users, especially marginalised groups and those who use drugs on the streets or in other risky and unhygienic conditions. One of their primary goals is to reduce morbidity and mortality by providing a safe environment for more hygienic drug use and by training clients in safer drug use. At the same time, they seek to reduce drug use in public and improve public amenity in areas surrounding urban drug markets. A further aim is to promote access to social, health and drug treatment facilities.""

3. Estimated Number of Safe Injection Facilities (SIFs) worldwide, 2009
""As of 2009, there were 65 safe injection facilities operating in 27 cities in eight countries.""

4. Public Health Benefits of Supervised Injection Facilities and Drug Consumption Facilities
""Consumption rooms achieve the immediate objective of providing a safe place for lower risk, more hygienic drug consumption without increasing the levels of drug use or risky patterns of consumption.
""Direct benefits of supervised injecting appear to be a reduction in some of the risk behaviours related to injecting, in particular improvements in injecting practice, use of sterile equipment and lack of opportunity for sharing drugs. Other benefits are that, if medical emergencies should occur, immediate medical intervention is possible, and the consumption equipment used in the rooms is correctly disposed of. Client surveys consistently show that service users appreciate the hygienic conditions, safety and peace that the rooms provide.""

5. Effectiveness and Benefits of Supervised Consumption Facilities
""Generally speaking, it is reasonable to conclude, on the basis of the available knowledge, that to a large extent DCFs [Drug Consumption Facilities] achieve the objectives set for them, and that the criticisms made of them are rarely justified. In fact, DCFs help to:
"" reduce risk behaviour likely to lead to the transmission of infectious diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, among the population of the worst affected drug users;
"" reduce the incidence of fatal overdoses and, therefore, the mortality rate in this population;
"" establish and maintain contact between this population and the social-service and health-care network, within which low-threshold facilities (LTFs) are often the First point of access because of the care and social assistance they offer;
"" reduce public order problems, particularly by doing away with open drug scenes, reducing drug use in public places, recovering used syringes, and reducing the impact of drug problems on residential areas (apartment buildings).

12. Benefits of SIFs - Improvements in Public Order and Reductions in Crime
""Our review suggests that SIFs target several public health problems that municipalities in North America may wish to consider, problems largely unaddressed by needle exchange, street-outreach, education campaigns, HIV counseling, and other conventional services. SIFs target injectors' use of public spaces to inject drugs in order to reduce the many risks associated with the practice. Compared to conventional services, SIFs provide greater opportunities for health workers to connect with injectors, and to move them into primary care, drug treatment, and other rehabilitation services. Finally, SIFs target the 'nuisance factor' of drug scenes -- the hazardous litter and intimidating presence of injectors congregating in city parks, public playgrounds and on street corners -- by offering them an alternative, supervised 'public' space. Our review also suggests that, for municipalities considering SIFs in order to address these problems, their implementation would not necessarily require any significant or fundamental changes in public policy or law: SIFs require the same working agreements with social service providers and the police that needle exchange, street-outreach, drug treatment and similar health programs for injectors already receive.""

“Twenty-seven cities — including Vancouver, British Columbia and Sydney, Australia — have successfully run these centers for decades. But there aren’t any injection sites in the United States. Svante Myrick, the mayor of Ithaca, New York, is hoping to end this national dearth by leading the first U.S. city to open a injection facility inspired by Vancouver’s model.”

“My father was a drug addict. He split from the family when I was 5, 6 years old,” Myrick told the Associated Press after announcing his proposal in February. ‘”I have watched for 20 years this system that just doesn’t work. We can’t wait anymore for the federal government. We have people shooting up in alleys. In bathroom stalls. And too many of them are dying.’”


“In 2014, the results of 75 research projects found that supervised injection facilities greatly reduced the rate of overdoses. A 2008 study found that patients who were monitored by a nurse while they injected heroin were more likely to enter addiction treatment. And other studies found these programs can successfully decrease the spread of HIV in a community.”

There's lots of studies. I don't really know what else to say if the effectiveness of other facilities in other cities to curb opioid related deaths, prevent the spread of HIV and ultimately help people eventually become sober isn't proof enough for you.

Having access to clean needles and supervised injection reduces harm from overdosing or getting infection from dirty needles (like HIV). This overall increases the health of users. Then, since you have direct access, they also have access to treatment programs. ",1487618352,16,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,20-02-2017,11:19:12,,,,,5v4z6a,1

http://www.ohtn.on.ca/Pages/Knowledge-Exchange/Rapid-Responses/Documents/RR83-Supervised-Injection-Effectiveness.pdf

Some of the key findings:

&gt; The use of supervised injection services can lead to reductions in injecting behaviour and an increase in the number of clients accessing addiction treatment services. 

And

&gt; Overdose morbidity and mortality are reduced when clients inject at supervised injection sites.

Worried about safety?

&gt; Supervised injection sites do not lead to any significant disruptions in public order or safety in the neighbourhoods where they are located.

**TL:DR** - supervised injection sites improve public health, reduce overdose deaths, and have no negative affect on public safety.

[There's a facility in Toronto doing the same thing.](https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2017/01/09/province-backs-and-will-fund-supervised-injection-sites-in-toronto.html) You offer a judgment free safe space to go, and in that space also offer paths to recovery. And you have trained staff to prevent OD deaths.

900+ people died from overdoses last year in Philadelphia alone. The facility in Toronto saw 700+ overdoses -- and not a single death because they had medically trained staff there to help.

Shouldn't the priority be making sure people aren't dying? This is a completely preventable epidemic -- 900 deaths last year could be cut in half in the upcoming year with something like this. And then, you also provide services to get people clean. ",1487604791,11,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,20-02-2017,07:33:11,,,,,5v4z6a,1
