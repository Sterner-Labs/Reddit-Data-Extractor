Study #76 from Alberta shows that many of the counter-intuitive arguments in favor of SIS were in fact incorrect. In particular, the record keeping at each SIS in the study was shoddy and definitions varied from site to site. Those previous studies can’t be trusted:

""The Committee heard reports of inadequate oversight and the lack of accountability mechanisms at the sites. Record keeping at the sites was and continues to be reportedly inconsistent, standardized definitions of concepts such as adverse events were absent, and no mechanisms appeared to be in place to assess the veracity of periodic reports submitted by the sites to Alberta Health.

For anyone questioning the effectiveness of supervised injection sites, please read this study done in 2014 which cites 44 different medical articles:
http://www.ohtn.on.ca/Pages/Knowledge-Exchange/Rapid-Responses/Documents/RR83-Supervised-Injection-Effectiveness.pdf

**Some of the key findings:**

The use of supervised injection services can lead to reductions in injecting behaviour and an increase in the number of clients accessing addiction treatment services.
**And**
Overdose morbidity and mortality are reduced when clients inject at supervised injection sites.
Worried about safety?
Supervised injection sites do not lead to any significant disruptions in public order or safety in the neighbourhoods where they are located.

**TL:DR** - supervised injection sites improve public health, reduce overdose deaths, and have no negative affect on public safety.",1487603061.0,114,False,t5_2qh24,Contact Kenney's Opioid Task Force and tell them you support supervised injection sites in North Philadelphia to curb the amount of overdose-related deaths in this city.,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/5v4z6a/contact_kenneys_opioid_task_force_and_tell_them/,,158,False,,1489569634,philadelphia,,20-02-2017,07:04:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/5v4z6a/contact_kenneys_opioid_task_force_and_tell_them/,,1487623366,,,1

Additional evaluations from Milloy's group and [the regional health ministry](http://www.health.gov.bc.ca/library/publications/year/2011/decreasing-HIV-in-IDU-population.pdf) found that Insite [averted about 50 deaths](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003351) in the first three to four years of operation; that people were less likely to engage in behaviors that would lead to HIV infections; and, that those who used Insite were [more likely to initiate detoxing](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.01818.x) from drugs and access treatment like methadone, compared to those who weren't using the facility.""",1595349409.0,1,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,21-07-2020,09:36:49,,,,False,hv323b,1
80,fyrvwxj,,fyrv9ib,468dy,HornyNarwhal,comment,Eli-Azrael,"""Supervised injection sites"" have never proven to decrease the overall # of opioid-related overdose deaths. The site in Canada that Kenney spoke with has done a masterful job of transforming the information of their statistics to help swindle people into believing it, but it's a false narrative.

In fact, in Montreal they now have MORE overdose deaths than they did 15 years ago. If this concept worked in Philly, we would have a lot less syringe drug use, and AIDS, given Rendell already did ""Prevention Point"" in 90's.

But Philly remains the HIGHEST opioid overdose death city in the nation, and we have 5x the national average of AIDS cases. It was a nice theory 30 years ago, but has proven disastrous every single time. A complete failure.

Also, cannabis has legal distribution across the nation, so it makes sense to allow its consumption recreationally in public spaces. Heroin, oxycontin (not prescribed), and other injected narcotics are still schedule 1 so their use shouldn't be enabled.

These sites collect samples from their ""clients,"" which are sent to labs for testing, which is a known insurance scam even Jon Oliver reported on it. They call piss ""liquid gold"" in those kinds of environments. No telling who owns the right to any DNA or lineage testing they do, too.

In the piece Krasner stated that “ In Canada, where OPS is legal, harm reduction workers reported seeing an [immediate spike in overdoses](https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2020/04/16/citys-busiest-supervised-injection-site-to-reopen-after-month-long-closure-over-covid-19.html) when some OPS were temporarily closed in the name of social distancing.”

That seems to be at least one case study that Krasner is using to support his opinion. Most of the responses on reddit to the article seem to be the lowest form of an argument (name-calling).

125,eon69ig,,bsghor,1wn42ucw,,comment,icallitwormlog2,"&gt; For the first time since 2013, the annual number of overdose deaths in Philadelphia has declined — 1,116 people died of an overdose in 2018 — 101 fewer deaths than in 2017. It is too early to know what to make of the 8 percent reduction. One year of data doesn’t give us much information about what’s to come. The decline in overdose deaths between 2012 and 2013 -- a 15 percent reduction — was nothing more than the calm before the storm.

Everyone I know who works in Philly public health attributes the decline to flooding the populace with Narcan (like the next paragraph says). It's bizarre that the editorial board says it's ""too early to know"" a conclusion that the actual experts have reached a consensus on, then turn around and say that ""Public-health advocates and experts have hung their hopes on a supervised injection site to further reduce overdose deaths"", as if there's a consensus there but not about Narcan.

Think about what makes drug-addled neighborhoods so bad: people running around, committing crime, overdosing in the streets, selling drugs, and the violence that occurs related to that.

That pretty well describes the neighborhood, does it not? 

Now think about what the inclusion of a supervised injection site means: reduced overdosing in the streets. Reduced numbers of addicts in the streets, since they'll be at the site. A stronger police presence at and around the site, and a population less afraid of being arrested, due to what amounts to a public announcement that using drugs at the site will go unpunished. Reduced selling of drugs, reduced crime, and reduced associated violence due to the increased police presence. Increased presence of social service help at the site with the end goal of fewer addicts and more recovered addicts. Reduced drugs in the neighborhood around the site as users go to the site instead of your front step.

We can argue all we want about the root cause of addiction, and whether the blame lies on the users or the system--but from either side of the political spectrum, the solution is clear: get these people off drugs.

&gt; https://www.aclupa.org/files/3214/3326/0426/Guilty_Property_Report_-_FINAL.pdf

Your link strengthens and reaffirms all the points I've made, so thank you for sharing it:

&gt; Every year, Pennsylvania law enforcement agencies take roughly $14 million in cash,
&gt; cars, and homes from property owners and never give it back.1 **These confiscations are
&gt; authorized by state civil asset forfeiture laws** — powerful legal tools that let police and
&gt; prosecutors seize and keep property that they claim was connected to a crime.2

[..]

&gt; **Under state civil forfeiture laws, all the revenue generated from forfeiture goes directly to law
&gt; enforcement and can even be distributed to police and prosecutors as bonuses.**5 As a result,
&gt; the agencies making enforcement decisions have a strong financial incentive to pursue as
&gt; many forfeitures as possible. In Philadelphia, the district attorney’s share of forfeiture proceeds
&gt; is roughly $2.2 million — or 7.3% of its appropriated budget.6 **Assuming forfeiture proceeds are
&gt; split between prosecutors and police in a similar ratio across the state, DA’s offices in other
&gt; counties aren’t far behind.** In fact, in four out of the next ten most populous counties, the DA
&gt; would receive the equivalent of about 5% of its budget in forfeiture proceeds.7

[..]

&gt; Worrying evidence suggests that the profits and sweeping powers offered by civil forfeiture
&gt; have distorted a tool originally targeted at cartels and drug kingpins.9 An article in the
&gt; Philadelphia City Paper in 2012 indicated that Philadelphia prosecutors regularly forfeit sums
&gt; as small as $100 and that people trying to get their property back sometimes had to attend
&gt; upwards of ten court dates just to reach a hearing before a judge.10 Other media accounts
&gt; chronicled the human toll of civil forfeiture. In one, a Philadelphia grandmother faced losing her
&gt; home because a grandson sold a small amount of drugs out of it.11 In another, a Lancaster
&gt; mother had $300 seized from her purse when her son was arrested on narcotics charges.12
&gt; 
&gt; **Law enforcement argues that stories like these are outliers and that the vast majority of
&gt; forfeitures target criminals and their ill-gotten gains.**

[..]

&gt; Both in Philadelphia and across the
&gt; nation, data on **the percentage of people
&gt; who lose property to civil forfeitures without
&gt; ever being found guilty of a crime is scant.**

&gt; One Philadelphia reporter conservatively
&gt; estimated the yearly income from these
&gt; innocent owner forfeitures in the hundreds of
&gt; thousands of dollars.40 After analyzing a
&gt; randomized sample of over 300 cash cases
&gt; from 2011 to 2013 , however, our
&gt; investigation **revealed that even that startling
&gt; estimate is low.** 

[..]

&gt;  Indeed, while our investigation was limited
&gt; to Philadelphia County, **its findings suggest the
&gt; broader dangers inherent to a law rooted in a
&gt; basic contradiction: that the government can
&gt; forfeit property connected to a crime without
&gt; proving that the owner is guilty.**


[..]

&gt; **Sensible reform wouldn’t eliminate forfeiture as a
&gt; crime-fighting tool. Rather, it would replace the
&gt; fiction that property is guilty with the truth that
&gt; only people commit crimes**. This fundamental
&gt; shift — from civil forfeiture to what is termed
&gt; “criminal forfeiture” — would mean that forfeiture
&gt; would occur as part of the underlying criminal
&gt; case and only after the property owner is
&gt; convicted. In that way, **every person facing
&gt; forfeiture would receive the full range of
&gt; protections our founding fathers intended** for
&gt; people accused of crimes. Meaningful reform
&gt; would also ensure forfeiture enforcement was democratically accountable by channeling the
&gt; proceeds from forfeiture into a general county or state fund that would be distributed through
&gt; the normal budgeting process, instead of directly into the coffers of law enforcement as an
&gt; off-budget revenue stream with no political oversight. Police and prosecutors would then be
&gt; required to fund forfeiture enforcement in the same way they fund every other type of
&gt; enforcement activity: by making requests through the regular budgeting process.

Please read the portions I've highlighted as important.

&gt; Beth Grossman's signature appeared on nearly all claims against cash in Philadelphia between 2003 and 2015.

From your source:

&gt; the DA’s office files the same boilerplate petition in every cash case


and since you pointed out what she said in defense of herself here:

&gt; ""I reviewed every case, I did not abuse the law."" Which means she believes, in spite of what the courts have said, that she was right.

I'd like to point you right back to your own source:

and on Safe-Injection sites:

&gt; Because when it was tried in Vancouver it drastically increased treatment referrals, which would reduce the number of junkies on the street (And thus junkie committed crimes).

Let's look at some real statistics because this is an area I disagree with both DA candidates on:

&gt; Vancouver’s Insite supervised injection center opened in 2003 and has seen nearly 3.5 million visits since then. Here are statistics for use in 2015:

&gt; • 263,713 visits by 6,532 individuals
&gt; 
&gt; • Average 722 visits per day
&gt; 
&gt; • 768 overdoses
&gt; 
&gt; • 5,368 referrals to social and health services
&gt; 
&gt; • 464 referrals to Onsite detox center
&gt; 
&gt; • 262 completed drug treatment.
&gt;
&gt;Vancouver Coastal Health

And here's the problem with people that just want to transpose this model to the United States, social-service and health-care networks don't exist, especially not for bottom-social-rung low or no income drug users. Supervised usage sites are a bridge between addiction and treatment and they're effective in so far as getting people to treatment when it exists and is available. The problem is this isn't Europe and those services largely don't exist for people without money here.

Safe injection sites are a nice virtue-signal, but they're not going to do anything to combat the problem proper, and any money for funding them needs to instead be spent on establishing the underlying services that make them so effective in other models.

__Supervised Consumption Facilities and Safe Injection Facilities__



1. Supervised Injection Facilities (SIFs), Sanitary Consumption Facilities (SCFs), and Drug Consumption Rooms (DCRs)
""Drug consumption rooms are professionally supervised healthcare facilities where drug users can consume drugs in safer conditions. They seek to attract hard-to-reach populations of drug users, especially marginalised groups and those who use drugs on the streets or in other risky and unhygienic conditions. One of their primary goals is to reduce morbidity and mortality by providing a safe environment for more hygienic drug use and by training clients in safer drug use. At the same time, they seek to reduce drug use in public and improve public amenity in areas surrounding urban drug markets. A further aim is to promote access to social, health and drug treatment facilities.""

3. Estimated Number of Safe Injection Facilities (SIFs) worldwide, 2009
""As of 2009, there were 65 safe injection facilities operating in 27 cities in eight countries.""

4. Public Health Benefits of Supervised Injection Facilities and Drug Consumption Facilities
""Consumption rooms achieve the immediate objective of providing a safe place for lower risk, more hygienic drug consumption without increasing the levels of drug use or risky patterns of consumption.
""Direct benefits of supervised injecting appear to be a reduction in some of the risk behaviours related to injecting, in particular improvements in injecting practice, use of sterile equipment and lack of opportunity for sharing drugs. Other benefits are that, if medical emergencies should occur, immediate medical intervention is possible, and the consumption equipment used in the rooms is correctly disposed of. Client surveys consistently show that service users appreciate the hygienic conditions, safety and peace that the rooms provide.""

5. Effectiveness and Benefits of Supervised Consumption Facilities
""Generally speaking, it is reasonable to conclude, on the basis of the available knowledge, that to a large extent DCFs [Drug Consumption Facilities] achieve the objectives set for them, and that the criticisms made of them are rarely justified. In fact, DCFs help to:
"" reduce risk behaviour likely to lead to the transmission of infectious diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, among the population of the worst affected drug users;
"" reduce the incidence of fatal overdoses and, therefore, the mortality rate in this population;
"" establish and maintain contact between this population and the social-service and health-care network, within which low-threshold facilities (LTFs) are often the First point of access because of the care and social assistance they offer;
"" reduce public order problems, particularly by doing away with open drug scenes, reducing drug use in public places, recovering used syringes, and reducing the impact of drug problems on residential areas (apartment buildings).

12. Benefits of SIFs - Improvements in Public Order and Reductions in Crime
""Our review suggests that SIFs target several public health problems that municipalities in North America may wish to consider, problems largely unaddressed by needle exchange, street-outreach, education campaigns, HIV counseling, and other conventional services. SIFs target injectors' use of public spaces to inject drugs in order to reduce the many risks associated with the practice. Compared to conventional services, SIFs provide greater opportunities for health workers to connect with injectors, and to move them into primary care, drug treatment, and other rehabilitation services. Finally, SIFs target the 'nuisance factor' of drug scenes -- the hazardous litter and intimidating presence of injectors congregating in city parks, public playgrounds and on street corners -- by offering them an alternative, supervised 'public' space. Our review also suggests that, for municipalities considering SIFs in order to address these problems, their implementation would not necessarily require any significant or fundamental changes in public policy or law: SIFs require the same working agreements with social service providers and the police that needle exchange, street-outreach, drug treatment and similar health programs for injectors already receive.""

“Twenty-seven cities — including Vancouver, British Columbia and Sydney, Australia — have successfully run these centers for decades. But there aren’t any injection sites in the United States. Svante Myrick, the mayor of Ithaca, New York, is hoping to end this national dearth by leading the first U.S. city to open a injection facility inspired by Vancouver’s model.”

“My father was a drug addict. He split from the family when I was 5, 6 years old,” Myrick told the Associated Press after announcing his proposal in February. ‘”I have watched for 20 years this system that just doesn’t work. We can’t wait anymore for the federal government. We have people shooting up in alleys. In bathroom stalls. And too many of them are dying.’”


“In 2014, the results of 75 research projects found that supervised injection facilities greatly reduced the rate of overdoses. A 2008 study found that patients who were monitored by a nurse while they injected heroin were more likely to enter addiction treatment. And other studies found these programs can successfully decrease the spread of HIV in a community.”
