We need to knock some shit off, especially on this sub. This whole transplants vs. lifelong is bullshit. Politics, which were made to separate us, is the place where I think a lot of this shit starts. I’m a lifelong resident. 35. Some of you transplants annoy the fuck out of me, but at the end of the day, it’s because you guys are so nice. Some of you truly believe that everyone in the world is terrific. I commend you for that. I can’t live that way, this city has proven that it cannot be trusted. 

With that said the holdovers and the transplants all have something in common. We are all here because we like it. We are all here because we think the neighborhood we are in is safe. We may have different ideas on how to keep them safe, but we all want the best for our areas. 

The SIS made me think about something. When I was a kid, Passyunk Ave. was what Broad Street looks like now. A couple stores, dead a lot of the time. Did have the awesome King of Jeans. It was most transplants/hipsters that revitalized Passyunk Ave. and it’s great now. 

What I’m getting at is, it’s really time to get together. This SIS was jammed down a lot of our throats, transplants who moved into a neighborhood because they liked it, and holdovers who have lived here, doing our best to keep it nice. The city, these politicians don’t care about any of us. They just want us to come out and vote. They sold us all out, the residents. We the people, are all we have. Time to knock the shit off and stick together. 

To the holdovers, it’s never going going to be how it was. Times change. This place, this neighborhood is still better and unique than any place in the world 

To the transplants, you belong to this now. This is yours now too. Stop looking down on those who’ve lived here.

17,g5yz9dm,,g5yk3vi,4poemsuz,Lanthemandragoran,comment,napsdufroid,"You make a lot of assumptions to support your quasi-scientific beliefs. First, I never said anything about prison being the answer, so you're already putting incorrect words in my mouth. Second, I'm not a right person; my politics are squarely left, so you're wrong again. Third, my emotional viewpoint, as you insist on putting it, isn't based on stuff I heard or programs such as DARE or religion; it's based on contact I've had with dozens of junkies, and direct experience with 4 that led to that contact with dozens of others.

You apparently like bending facts or pulling stuff out of your ass to make it fit your narrow viewpoint.

We've had this convo before, so I'll just replay what I already said:

It's as ""factually wrong"" as your statement that most start with prescription drugs after a profound injury [which you claimed before]. And I didn't talk to ""someone."" I talked to literally dozens of addicts in two different places many separate times. Not only did none of them start with ""scrips, but a number openly said they initially tried it for the kick. That sounds like a conscious choice. And I'm not coming from a place of ignorance. I did research on addiction because I really wanted to try to understand it. The data out there does not offer absolute proof it's not a choice, and all your rhetoric doesn't change that. You can delude yourself -- and make no mistake, that's all it is on your part -- that I'm basing my belief in the many situations I encountered on ignorance, but you'll still be wrong.

How I personally feel about junkies is one thing. I have no more sympathy for them; I've seen far too much residual trauma and damage to families and ""innocent bystanders."" How I feel they should be treated is another. Those who truly want help seek it and deserve to get it. But they have to want it. If they don't, enabling and coddling them is an exercise in total futility. And that's not debatable because of how you feel.

You seem to love to vilify anyone who doesn't agree with coddling and enabling junkies. You pontificate a lot and like to pretend you're somehow morally superior, but you've yet to offer one viable solution that will solve the current problem. But I'll ask you the same question others have asked others who keep spewing the ""Butbutbut it's a disease"" line without offering any solution: How many junkies are you willing to take into your home to help them? How willing are you to have junkie encampments on your street or an SIS next to your home? Lead by example.

As far as what I think the solution is, beyond arresting and jailing the dealers and starting to dry up the supply, I'm not 100% sure. As far as junkies go, I don't think it's prison, as you -- again completely incorrectly -- assumed above. I believe those who truly want treatment should have access. But as for those who don't or refuse it, forced rehab may be an answer. That's NOT the same as prison in the traditional sense, but yes, it does involve an element of holding them against their will for treatment so they can't go out and score more heroin. Is it ideal? Of course not. But it's a start to getting them off the streets and letting people reclaim their neighborhoods without worrying about shit on the sidewalk, needles everywhere, and junkies shooting up outside of schools. I think it's already been clear that constantly handing them fresh needles hasn't been the solution. Nor is giving them a place to shoot up without repercussions; the Canada example has pretty much proven that.",1600605724,0,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,20-09-2020,05:42:04,,,1600606501.0,False,ivch9c,1

Additionally they are not the factor that reduced deaths last year. The whole article in context points to the availability of narcan, and better EMS response as being the significant changes that have reduced deaths. Not the SIS. It also shows that over doses are at all times highs, so it's failed at reducing that as well.

So by your own admission SIS bring crime, and they can't be attributed as the sole factor at reducing OD deaths. Cities without an SIS having also a had reduction in OD deaths, further leads creditability to the notion that we can reduce OD deaths without an SIS. Importantly it can be done without the associated concentrated rise in crime and blight.

That the number of overdoses went up around the SIS sites, as did the number of deaths. Today they are at all time highs for overdoses while deaths have started decreasing. However the decrease in deaths isn't attributed to the SIS it's attributed to abundance of narcan, and faster EMS response. 

Crime went up in the surrounding area, and quality of life went down. 

The sites get less then a 3% referral rate to treatment, and the BC health department has said the sites attracted in drug tourism. 

The studies that safe house were done by insite Candace, and suffer from several problems, most notably interpretation bias, and that they cut the studies off just as fentanyl entered into the drug supply spiking the death rates. 

So let's recap:

The sites did nothing to get people into treatment.

They increased the crime rates around them.

The brought down the quality of life for people around them with increase in used syringes laying around, human filth such as public defecation, increasing communicable diseases, and increase in blight.

They saw increased drug usage and overdoses including deaths.

The decline in deaths is because of betting EMS service, not the injection site.

&gt; (a) Any plan to operate a Supervised Injection Site shall be publicized to every resident, business, and institution within a one mile radius of the proposed location at least six
months prior to planned operation of such site.

(b) The proposed Supervised Injection Site shall provide a detailed plan of operation to the residents, businesses, and institutions three months prior to holding a public hearing.

(c) The hearing must be held at least three months prior to the planned date of operation. 

(d) The proposed Supervised Injection Site may not operate without approval of 90% of the residents, businesses, and institutions within the one mile radius of the facility.

(e) If criteria (a) through (d) are satisfied, then City Council shall vote to approve or disapprove the operation of the proposed Supervised Injection Site unless its operation is already determined to be a violation of Commonwealth or Federal criminal laws in
which case, such facility shall not operate.

Yes and it's an opinion the majority of people seem to share, or else there wouldn't be such a backlash against this idea.

People who are Pro-SIS constantly say there are ""studies"" that show that there's no correlated increase in crime, without providing any actual sources. To my original point, crime is just one part of it.  Nobody wants the E. Passyunk Square area to turn into K&amp;A.

&gt;Here’s a fact - there are already drug users in south Philadelphia, wandering the streets, sitting under 95, doing whatever they do all day.

Yes that is true.  But a few homeless drug users strewn throughout a neighborhood is far different than the tent city that will develop if an SIS was actually operational.  Seriously. Look up what it looks like outside Insite in Vancouver.  It does *not* look like that at the location that was proposed here.  

&gt;Adding a place to connect them to resources, and possible prevent them from killing themselves, is probably going to do more good than harm. The point is to connect them to help.

I mean yes, like I said before, most people are not arguing that it is a good idea to help people with substance abuse issues. The point is that people do not want to help in a way that would hurt themselves.

&gt;I’d rather have them have a place to shoot up safely than the alleyways and parks where they currently do this.

Yes, an SIS is likely to save lives.  I don't think anyone is doubting that.  Most people are simply saying that basically ruining a community to help save the lives of those who don't give a shit about themselves or society is not a cost they will be willing to pay.

Putting an SIS in any location is going to make it ground zero for being swamped by drug addicts, including a large number of homeless people that are going to set up camp around the SIS and completely change the character of the neighborhood for the worse.  Not to mention the after effects of dealers going where the supply is.  Right now that is K&amp;A; it will likely move to wherever there an SIS is built if one is.

The link you have in your post only has one small line even addressing this, 

&gt;Stefanson said that when Insite opened “there were concerns that it would increase crime, but that has not been borne out.” 

This statement isn't backed up by any sort of scientific study at all, and is in fact, just on person's opinion on the issue.  And it completely ignores that ""an increase in crime"" is just one undesirable outcome people don't want to see.  Newsflash, people don't want homeless drug addicts, who are also usually suffering from mental illness or otherwise mentally unstable, languishing in the streets of their neighborhood, even if they're not breaking the law.  And you can look for yourself at what it looks like outside of Insite in Vancouver....it's not pretty.  Nobody wants to their neighborhood to look like that.

Why should the lives of people who have no desire to get help be made paramount to the interests of an entire community?  It's not like this is a methadone or rehab clinic where people struggling are at least putting an effort in. Nobody, and I mean nobody, is ever going to voluntarily let their community go to shit just so there will be a few less addicts dying from injecting themselves with poison.",1582918688,1,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,28-02-2020,11:38:08,,,,False,fauare,1

As I understand it, the plan is that they're open for 4ish hours a day, the clientelle are offered ""literature"" for getting off the junk in exchange for signing **A** name, not even necessarily **THEIR** name, with no ID, and then they're provided fresh tools for enabling their addiction.  How long are they allowed to linger and ride off their high? What is the SIS doing for them once they walk out the door, or are their hands clean once they're outside the building? Are these junkies then packing up their briefcases of drugs and taking a happy jaunt home? Or are they going to be lingering around the SIS, or the closest gas station or Wawa to panhandle for their next hit?  How about when they decide to take a nap on somebody's front steps?  Where they'll have 911 called so that whoever arrives on the scene can administer narcan, ruin their high and have them still end up in an ER.  Oh, or better yet, they'll snap to, possibly become violent from having their high ruined and now they're also stranded in the neighborhood because they refuse their ambulance ride or run or what have you.

Or how about the junkies who didn't responsibly score their heroin before hopping on the broad Street line or El to safely do their drugs? Oh, they'll just go to the dealers posted up around the SIS facility to score! Sweet! Who wouldn't want that on their block? 

Are the police going to be allowed to crack down on the area and break up drug deals? I imagine that'll deter people from using SIS buildings because, let's be real, they're not trying to get their drugs and then commute for any extended time when they can just use the closest McDonald's or National Park restroom much more conveniently.

You can go back and re-read my first comment where I list all of the different areas a ""comprehensive"" plan would have to address. There's no contradiction, it would simply be impossible for one single agency, local or national, to ""comprehensively"" address the crisis. Not only because the amount of funding would be absurd, but because it would NEVER make it to the point of opening due to the state of politics in the country.

&gt; In between the two sentences you quoted, I listed several examples of what I would be looking for in what I would consider a comprehensive policy, none of which would be that difficult for a City of Philadelphia's size.

And in my response, I offered you what I would be looking for to consider it a ""comprehensive"" policy as someone working in the field. The City (setting aside for a second that the goalposts have once again shifted from one agency to the city as a whole) would be incapable of accomplishing some of those things on their own: namely universal healthcare and ending the War on Drugs.

&gt; Even if you start to include socio-economic issues, which I assume is what you are getting hung up on with my use of the word ""comprehensive"", what is stopping the city from acknowledging them?

Uhhh, what other definition of ""comprehensive"" is there that isn't all-encompassing. There is not one single provider left in the country that would tell you social determinants of health outcomes aren't relevant to a comprehensive approach. This is precisely why CBH is moving the city towards ""treatment on demand"" and integrating services at a single site (different providers at the same location). Again, this is where listening to people with expertise and actual experience in the field is relevant.

&gt; I fail to see why I can't want or expect comprehensive planning from policymakers.

Yeah, this is just a strawman. I'm not telling you that you CAN'T expect it, what I'm telling you is that your expectations for a single agency to be able to provide a comprehensive solution for a problem which requires policy change at the federal and local level are untenable.

&gt; Are you pro or anti-SIS - are you saying that since no agency can make an impact they shouldn't bother until the government steps in or that we should be satisfied with one agency ""doing its best"" to aid a multi-faceted issue?

I would say 'pro with tempered expectations'. I see it as harm reduction primarily and as another opportunity to get folks into treatment, but supporters of SIS aren't under any illusions that it's going to be the magic wand that will clean up the streets. I was never saying that they shouldn't go forward with this because it wasn't comprehensive, I was simply pointing out that it's not reasonable or feasible to expect one agency to be able to do every single thing that needs to be done to end the crisis.

We’ve got a public health crisis ongoing.   I live two blocks from there and I can tell you the opioid crisis is here now.   The Snyder street stop on and off has had homeless encampments for years now.   The High school started chaining off their parking lot about a year ago because of needles and feces due to the encampments.

The Anti-SIS folks sound like the abstinence only sex-ed folks.   They are in denial about what is happening now, and in denial about how a place like this would save lives.  Some of those lives could very well be people very close to them.  I will bet every one of us on here knew someone who has passed from an overdose.  If you don’t, you are very lucky.

BTW, the pictures of Vancouver have been all over the place and anyone sharing them to discourage the Philly SIS is being dishonest or ignorant.  Vancouver has a severe homelessness problem, in part due to some of the highest housing costs in North America (1Mill+ median housing price).   The mayor, the police, and the community all seem in general agreement that the Vancouver SIS has helped improve the conditions in the neighborhood.",1582821974,0,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,27-02-2020,08:46:14,,,,False,fa6g7l,1

There was a time 20 or so years ago when the city decided to stop them. They did Operation Safe Streets and later Operation Safer Streets, iirc.

They posted a cop on every corner that was a known drug dealing corner.

It worked. Dealing stopped on those corners and things became safer.

However the dealing just moved to other areas and indoors. Eventually the money ran out and all the over time and extra policing had to stop.

The corners opened back up.

Drug dealing and drug use is a very complicated issue with a lot of factors. You can't just cut one head off and leave the 15 others remaining. The organism will still function.

There is no easy solution to it, other than taking it out of illegal hands and providing help to the people that are unfortunate enough to be addicts.

Here's what I found:
&gt; One high-quality cohort study examined overdose mortality before and after an SIS opened in Vancouver, BC.1
 Of persons living within 500 m of the SIS (70% of SIS users), overdose deaths decreased from 253 to 165 per 100 000 PYs and the absolute risk difference was 88 deaths per 100 000 PYs; 1 overdose death was prevented annually for every 1137 users. There was no change in mortality in the rest of city.

It was an evaluation done by the Canadian government. The sis helps users be ready to seek treatment because they make the users feel more comfortable. I think we need to treat addicts better.

&gt;	what are your reasons for opposing sis besides property values?

SIS are harm reduction for the user, they dont do much to reduce the harm the user does to the community they’re in. A SIS isn’t a homeless shelter, it won’t reduce the people sleeping on the street or shitting on the street. A SIS doesn’t give out free drugs, users will still steal anything that isn’t bolted down. It won’t reduce violent crime or property crime in the area. Every study I have ever seen is quite carful to always word reduced crime rates as specifically relating to drug crime.

I would also like to see the primary source for their claim that it doesn’t encourage drug tourism. Sorry, but I don’t believe the word of junkies on a survey. Philly already has a drug tourism problem, bringing in users from across the tristate area. 

I would also like to see some numbers behind their claims of detox and relapse. Addicts don’t get clean unless they want to, providing resources and outreach for when they’re ready is possible without a SIS.

There is no one solution to opioid problem. I’d like to see pharma companies and pill mills prosecuted for getting people hooked to begin with. Once someone is an addict there isn’t much you can do until they want to get clean.

 All of your questions could be partially answered using templates large organizations use for similar public facing facilities.

They seem to have a lot to say about why their idea is so great but don't seem to be able to communicate much about the critical component of security. 

I suspect the organization has a lot of ideas about what they want to do but are intentionally withholding as much as possible from the public so it is easier for them to move forward.  The citizens of Philadelphia have a right to know the details so that there can be input from stakeholders. 

  
 

* How many security personnel need to be on hand during business hours? And how many should be on standby to cover for unexpected absences?  *Number of personnel is largely a function of square footage and store frontage. Standby is generally a percentage of full time personnel. The organization could point to best practices they will follow.* 
* Where will security personnel be stationed within and around the facility, and what physical upgrades will be required to protect and equip them? *There are best practices here as well. Number of personnel per entrance available to the public and per entrance that are staff only.* 
* What type of surveillance system will be required, how many cameras, which locations, retaining recordings for how long? *Again, largely a function of square footage and store frontage. Not sure why recording retention policies would change by location. Would you mind explaining?*
* How long is the expected response time from the local police district and EMS station? What emergency services should be provided on site to address lags?  *This would require them to be up front and choose a neighborhood.  The vast majority of us suspect Kensington for obvious reasons. I suspect they already have this in mind but are holding back information to avoid backlash.  Assuming it is Kensington, the number of suitable sites would be relatively few and easier to address the answers above.*",1571157371,1,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,15-10-2019,09:36:11,,,,False,di89b0,1

Many of them have been affected by loss from addiction and they found each other and asked if there was a better way.

My only twist on it for Philly is that now that Rhode Island has done the legal leg work, and collected the 
high quality data, is to put it into mass application. 

For any junkies found nodding out in public places like parks, libraries, SEPTA, police / fire have to come, ect; we charge them with the associated drug crimes for being in a public place. But instead of prison we send them through a drug court who can mandate they complete the MAT program. 

Think of it as a tough love intervention, from the city of brotherly love. 

It's not perfect with a 60% success rate, but it's orders of magnitude better then what we're, or Canada are doing now; which is effectively nothing to help the person. 

Currently we're just looking at the disease, not the person. We need to treat the person, which what MAT does, SIS just addresses symptoms.

MAT is the only program so far to get success rates that high. It's also way better then SIS in that it has high quality published data to support it.

449,f2ajf6s,,f27uzxf,13ozz2,sugxrpunk,comment,Nylund,"I spent a bit of time reading some studies on this. SIS have good numbers in terms of people not dying onsite. They have drugs, oxygen, EMT on speed dial, etc.  Not surprising.

Also not surprising: only some people use SIS, and the ones that do only sometimes use it.

I didn’t see many studies that tried to quantify the effect on morbidity.

There was one from 2008 where they ran Monte Carlo simulations based on data from a SIS in Vancouver.

(Simple version: you calculate the probability that a person will or won’t use an SIS, the probability of them ODing when they inject, and the probability of that OD being fatal, conditional on whether or not they’re at an SIS, etc. You run thousands of simulations that way, then thousands of simulations where they probability of going to an SIS is zero, then compare the simulation results to compare the number of average fatalities under the scenario where some go to SIS facilities for some injections to the simulation results with no SIS.)

(Caveat: the methodology didn’t consider effects of things like sharing needles, spread of HIV, Hepatitis.  Just Fatal overdoses.)

They concluded the Vancouver SIS averted 2 to 12 deaths a year.

That sounds small, but Vancouver was experiencing about 38 deaths a year at the time of the study.  So as a percent, actually pretty large.

The question is, what could we expect in Philly?  We can’t assume it’ll be the same percent. Philly has about 70,000 opioid addicts and about 1,000 deaths a year.  A SIS would run into capacity constraints (unless it’s the size of a football stadium) long before it could achieve similar percent changes. 

At the low end, if the site is roughly the same size as the Vancouver one, and if the Vancouver one was running at capacity, then maybe it’s still just two to twelve.  Statistically, 2-12 in a city that has 1,000 deaths a year is basically zero effect. 

But maybe the Philly SIS would be bigger and results scale up. But how much? what number do we use?

Let’s say you take the high end, 12, and quadruple it, and round up. That gets you to 50. I’m just making a number up, and one can quibble.

My concern is that if that if it is about 50, that might end up still being pretty unmeasurable.  That would be about a 0.5% reduction. It’d probably be hard to separate that out from the statistical noise and other factors. 

If anything with potential to avert deaths is a goal, then try whatever.  I’m not trying to poo-poo any enthusiasm. Rather, if it happens, people will probably look into its effectiveness and it strikes me as quite possible that any reduction in morbidity could very well be statistically indistinguishable from zero.

Boosters of the SIS should prepare for that. It’s likely not going to result in any measurable decline of ODs.   It’s not quite throwing paper towels at hurricane victims, but a single SIS probably won’t have much of a measurable effect given the scale of Philly’s problem.

But probably more important is the reality that people are really hardened these days. There’s a large number of people who live daily with addicts pissing on their house and cars, stealing packages, breaking into homes, stripping metal off buildings, and all this shit gets sold and the money is handed to drug dealers who bring another set of problems to neighborhoods. 

And for the people whose daily lives are negatively affected by the dealers and addicts, when an addict just stops showing up one day, you breathe a sigh of relief and you don’t think too hard about *why* they stopped showing up. Sure, you hope they quit, recovered, and became a productive member of society, but honestly, *gone* is better than *not gone.* 

There’s a guy in my area who steals packages, steals bicycles, breaks into cars, dumps out trash cans, and deals drugs, etc. We’ve tried speaking to him, getting him help, calling 311, 911, etc. No one does anything. He’s physically threatened people (and their spouses and children) and frankly I’m amazed some pissed off threatened neighbor hasn’t kicked the shit out of him yet. 

Anyway, he disappeared for a few months and just this last week showed up again. My neighbor, a nurse, said to me, “damnit, he’s back. I was kinda hoping he died.”

Like, damn, thats cold, but I get where that sentiment is coming from. She’s a single woman who lives alone who has been physically threatened by him.

Of course, McSwain will argue the simplistic letter of the law on this. And ya know what? On that level, he's right. Without a doubt.

But, courts don't work that way. Statutory interpretation doesn't work that way. Courts take the intent of the legislators into account when considering laws. In this case, there's a good argument to be made that the SIS falls outside the intent of the ""Crackhouse Statute."" The first clue may be the widely repeated title of the statute. This law was in response to a very specific situation, at a very specific point in time. This is not that situation or time.

Clearly, the intent of the law was to address a continuing criminal enterprise, and thwart the manufacture and distribution of drugs. The SIS neither furthers the manufacture, distribution or consumption of drugs. All of that is happening right now, on the streets in that very neighborhood. There's no concrete (or even reasonable) evidence that the SIS will make any of that worse. I won't make it any better, either, but it's clearly not an attempt to sustain or further a criminal enterprise. Its intent is to prevent people who have already purchased, and will use, regardless of the presence of the SIS, a medically supervised site where they are not a public nuisance.

That's a reasonable and possibly winning argument, though I suspect it's the kind of thing that would kick around between appeals for years.",1567133083,1,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,29-08-2019,19:44:43,,,,False,cx55ba,1

**Key points:**

The survey with more opposing asked the question: “Should the city of Philadelphia designate an area where those who wish to inject themselves with illegal drugs are allowed to do so, free from the risk of arrest?”

The survey with about 50/50 with slightly more in favor, asked this question:
“Philadelphia is considering creating a safe site where opioid users could take their drugs under medical supervision. Is this something you favor or oppose?”

The poll should have asked the same two questions. The first question’s key phrase: “free from risk of arrest?”
Second question’s key phrase: “under medical supervision”

Notice how the first question is defining a SIS as a place for addicts to inject themselves without risk of legal repercussions, whereas the second question defines SIS as a place for opioid users to take their drugs under medical supervision. 

While both statements are technically *true*, I think it should go without saying really that the *reason* these sites have been successful in the past in other parts of the world, isn’t because they give addicts slack, but because they keep less hypodermics on the streets, they lessen the frequency of 911 calls for ODs and along with that, there are less ER visits for ODs, etc. etc.....

&gt; We want drug users in treatment far away from the drug dealers

So do we. The question is how do we get addicts into treatment? Do we round all the junkies up and force them into treatment at gunpoint? Or maybe we use harm-reduction services (As the Needle Exchange has been doing) such as *gasp* an SIS to build relationships at the grass roots level so they have a push to get treatment of their own volition.

&gt; we want the drug dealers in jail

Our country has been trying to put the drug dealers in jail for decades. How well has that worked? The truth is as long as there is a high demand for opiates on the streets there will be a broke kid in the Ghetto who has access to the drugs and will sell them to make money. Arresting our way out of this problem will not work. The focus needs to be on lowering demand and getting addicts away from the streets, while at the same time helping to improve our drug blighted neighborhoods (like Kensington). SIS sites can be a very good tool for this. 

&gt; Treatment should include but not be limited to Medication Assisted Treatment

Agreed, but again, your idea that we can magically make addicts go to treatment shows just how inexperienced you are regarding addiction. An SIS is one way we can, potentially, get addicts to go to treatment, and even if they don't, buys them time until they are willing/able to do so themselves.

&gt; People who refuse treatment, but prove to be public health and safety hazards should be 302'd.

Again, all of this sounds like the crux of your idea is to have cops going around arresting every addict they see, with or without evidence, and forcing them into rehab. Not only is this unrealistic (we tried that, just arresting them and throwing away the key, and it didnt work), but it ignores the fact that many addicts arent necessarily the ones sleeping under the el - many have jobs, homes, etc and arent gonna be able to be simply rounded up by the cops in this manner.

&gt; We don't want a SIS anywhere near a school, park, or playground.

I agree it should be offset from such buildings as much as possible, but the take most of you fellow anti-harm reduction folks makes it so you couldn't have an SIS anywhere. 

&gt; People who support SIS complain that everyone who disagrees with them ""wants people to die in the street"" and don't ""offer any alternatives"" They just aren't listening.

No, I'll admit it. You offer some suggestions. They are just archaic methods that have been proven either ineffective and/or unfeasible numerous times in the past.

I did some work in a local prison a few years ago through my college specifically looking at methods of combating drug addiction and the incarceration of those in active addiction. A lot of my time was spent talking with and interviewing inmates. This was years ago, before this debate started, and one of the things many of them hit on was a desire for exactly this. And no, not because they just wanted to shoot up. The repeating pattern was that they felt that having a SIS (obviously, not using the name) would have been a way to actually get them closer to getting clean. I think it was telling that in most of their imaginary sites, there were nurses who would offer to help them get into rehab, and programs designed to help them move in that direction. 

That is what a lot of you people don't understand. Most addicts don't want to be addicts. Most are stuck in a position where they desperately don't want to be. The problem is that often they feel as though they have no way out. That is why harm reduction strategies work; they offer an out to addicts slowly without judgement and allows people to build relationships .",1566666226,1,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,24-08-2019,10:03:46,,,,False,cughzc,1

There's no evidence thus far that having a SIS nearby lowers property values so I'm not sure where you got that 25% number from, but there is evidence it lowers HIV transmission rates and overdose deaths.  It's not like these people aren't already shooting up in public and making the area look like a scene from a Resident Evil game, so on the face of it the idea seems like a net positive to me.  That said, I'd be fully in favor of a multi-faceted study like the one you describe, as research is still limited.

So, when the drunk hits someone, it will be more catastrophic.

just a tip: when you spend the first two paragraphs downplaying the the risks of driving under the influence of heroin its really silly to open the third with ""Again, this is not to downplay the dangers of driving under the influence of heroine!""

Spoken like someone that hasn't been to Seattle.  What awful news source are you consuming?

&gt; The hard reality is that wherever this thing goes property and violent crime rates will spike. Drug dealers will be fighting constantly to be in control of a ready market right out side.

How, exactly, would you describe the state of Kenzo now?  Or at any point in the past 4 decades?  It's just as you describe.  Putting in a SIS won't make it any worse; it would make it -- at worst -- *exactly the same as it is now*.  That's worst case.  What you described is not only a fantastic example of not understanding cause and effect, but it's also a complete lack of understanding of decades of history.  

&gt; It will do nothing substantive to reduce OD rates, simply because it will not be 24/7/365 with enough staff or resources for a whole city's worth of junkies.

I see the problem here: You are ascribing a failure of a single hypothetical SIS to completely turn around of the entire city's and surrounding areas' addiction problems to a complete failure of the program as a whole.  Well done!  I don't suppose it's occurred to you that we could have more than one of these.  And that anyone advocating for SIS understands that it's not a panacea -- it would need to work in concert with outside support (cue delusional scumandvillany spam).  

&gt; If anything it will result in increased OD rates and deaths because it will give a false sense of security and attract yet more drug tourism.

I give it one week. 

On a more important note though, SIS is exactly the opposite of helping drug addicts. It's just another step on the road to becoming like Seattle, drug camps everywhere, rampant property crime, rampant violent crime, and the city being covered in shit and piss. 

The SIS movement as I've seen it in Philly is the worst kind of feel good-ism I've seen in a while. It makes people feel good that they support it, and somehow magic will happen and OD rates will go down, as well as crime, and poor neighborhoods will somehow magic improvements into them; and junkies will decide to get help and become functional members of society. It a giant fucking unicorn fantasy. 

The hard reality is that wherever this thing goes property and violent crime rates will spike. Drug dealers with being fighting constantly to be supplying a ready market right out side. It will do nothing substantive to reduce OD rates, simply because it will not be 24/7/365 with enough staff or resources for a whole city's worth of junkies. If anything it will result in increased OD rates and deaths because it will give a false sense of security and attract yet more drug tourism. If you've ever seen a suboxone clinic in the city it will be that on steroids. It will permanity impoverise any area within a few blocks of it. For those siting the Canada model, two big problems with that. One is that the location in Vancouver is in fact a shithole, the whole city is very beautiful until you walk the part the SIS is in, its a dump. Second is that Canada has a national healthcare system with which to support treatment outreach, Philadelphia does not. 

If you want to help clean up the city, and get junkies off the street then we need to live up to our name of the city of brotherly love, and start dispensing some tough love. We can't permit trespassing in public areas for drug camps, or tolerate people shooting up on our stoops, our sidewalks, or our parks. When we find these people they need to be arrested and charged then sent to involuntary treatment, where we can treat the addiction, provide social services, job training, and post treatment support to get them back on their feet.

While Kensington overdoses are highest, they tend to use in the open so open themselves up to stranger/friend aid, have prevention point as a place for daily needle exchange and treatment outreach, and the opioid community and places like libraries are very familiar with Narcan and Narcan administration already.  

On the other hand, opioid overdoses are on the rise in South Philadelphia.  There is still a stigma around drug use there, Narcan is less widely available/purchased, needle exchange is available only once a week, and people tend to do drugs in their homes where no one can help them.  If people would be willing to instead travel a few feet to the SIS to do drugs rather than use in their homes, we could maybe target a manageable number of drug users in a community that is underserviced for this particular problem.  Hopefully if the number is manageable more individual attention can be put on each person, more real connections can be made between providers and people regularly using the service and it can have a bigger impact.  Once we learn how the site works for a manageable population, then maybe we can use what we've learned to expand it to an area with a greater number of heroin addicts.

Read my post again. I'm opposed to SIS. It's not the solution, and the research backs that up. 

BUT tbf, it's never been advertised as a solution to getting people sober. It's preventive measures to stop spread the harm of AIDs and Hepatitis and also to reduce incidence of fatal ODs. The whole model is that they don't pressure or advertise to get people to seek treatment. At Insite, they maintain a bunch of pamphlets for information but because the model is judgment free, they're not sitting there pushing you to treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm opposed to it is because the research on these facilities show that the impact of one of these sites is so unbelievably small when up against the scope of the whole addict population that it's practically not much different from having no site at all. I actually posted the calculations here once, and you'd need an SIS the size of a large industrial warehouse to actually make a significant different.

The basic problem is this: You have 100k addicts, but can only serve 200 shots a day. That's 0.2% of the population. Then, factor in the fact that drug addicts use multiple times a day, and you find that these centers serve such a substantially small amount of ""shots"" per day. If the person doesn't OD at the facility, they're just OD'ing on their next round under the train tracks.

 for one, the communities that they might be in do not seem to want them.  it seems unfair to me to do that to a neighborhood.  the only argument that can be made against this is to say ""well, those neighborhoods have not been well informed about them, or they have been misinformed (either on purpose or out of a lack of good evidence.  I'm trying to keep all possibilities open here)"". ok, thats a fine argument to make, but then we need to ask ourselves ""what can we do to inform them better?  what kind of evidence can we present that would change their mind?""  and then we can go from there.

another issue is just logistics.  this might require some NSFW imagination.  but....what do you picture happening at this SIS?  and maybe more importantly, *outside* of them?  leaving aside the issue that usually comes up about ""long lines"", what I'm picturing is users go in, get help shooting up, and then are escorted out of the SIS (apparently, there will be a time limit)...and then...then what?  most likely nodding out right outside of them.  thats not a good scene.  it would make sense a neighborhood would not want that to be near them (not just because of potential property value loss, but also quality of life issues for kids).  maybe a location can be found that would prevent this from being an issue.  the location near erie/torresdale looks like the best as far as this is concerned.  

as far as SIS's providing social services for users, we already have programs like prevention point that do that, so why wouldn't we just fund that a little more instead of spending even more money on a brand new program/building?

Not that I think it’s smart for the university to build the thing because I don’t believe their football program will justify the cost of it.. but the development is great for the area and if it does work out then having a better university is good for the area. When people want to invest in these infrastructure projects, I see it as a good thing for the area with very few exceptions. 

I think zoning restrictions need to be eased, need taller buildings for residence in/along broad and they should allow taller buildings all the way down the BSL corridor. This city needs more affordable high density housing to encourage more use in public transit. More people who use and rely on public transit, the better we can make it and grow the city.  The only reason NYC public transit works and is efficient is because economies of scale. More people use it, the better service they can offer, more frequent routes and longer in the day, the more people can rely on it which it then increases daily riders. Philly just doesn’t have the population density to force people to use public transit. Most people use their cars because they can, in NYC, most people just can’t. There just physically isn’t the space, so it forces people to use other transit. 

Safe injection sites are used and have been demonstrated to improve public health for everyone. The opioid epidemic is a complex issue that needs be addressed in multiple different ways to make it better. It will never be fixed. Absolutely never.

People's opinions on drug policy tend to be based on experience. If you live in Kensington (and people on this sub do) then break-ins, thefts, and drug related shootings are a realty for you and that's going to make an SIS sound like a pretty raw deal. Most of the addicts are white and from the suburbs, putting it in a black and Hispanic neighborhood only entrenches those negative externalities without offering anything to the people who have to live and raise children in that neighborhood. 

More broadly, I think most people wildly overestimate how ""progressive"" the black community is on issues like crime and drug addiction. People also underestimate how conservative many white democrats are here. We currently have a mayor who styles himself as a progressive and a DA who won the primary with 39% of the vote. Kenny definitely had the backing of progressives but also had a lot of support from our very powerful trade unions.

But we do have 40 years of evidence that says that it alone is not enough, oh, and by the way, we might catch some innocents in our net and we might trample some rights along the way.

If we're going to pay for policing -- reducing demand via negative reinforcement -- something that is known to not work on its own and has a significant resource cost, IMO it makes sense to supplement that with SIS -- reducing demand via positive reinforcement with a much lower per-capita resource cost.

I'm not going to sit here and call SIS a panacea.  SIS are, on their own, also not going to solve the issue of what happens to humans when opiates reprogram their brains.  But it's relatively easily implemented, and cheap, and better than nothing.

I think it's nice that MQS and friends swept up recently.  But it's very possible that's all this is, a photo op.

It's my mantra. 

&gt;But I'm sorry, I absolutely do not want one by me.

Nor do I. It's hard to put myself in the shoes of someone who 1) currently has the drug epidemic on their block/front stoop, and 2) does not have the means to move somewhere else. But it's also hard to put myself in the shoes of someone who's that poor, already. 

I feel sympathy for the innocent victims of the drug epidemic, but for me, the blame lies in the same place as it does for a lot of the addicts: Purdue pharma pushing addictive drugs across America and facilitating the resurgence of an addiction crisis that we just didn't need. 

Obviously the vast majority of heroin addicts are culpable in at least some way for their own addiction. But I just can't get past the fact that blaming addicts solves nothing. It doesn't get them off the street, it doesn't get them clean, and it doesn't make Kensington a better, safer place to live. 

&gt;I shouldn't have to suffer for another's poor choices.

In a just world, this should always be true. My response would be that between the random nature of the universe, and the nature of our political and technological limitations, there are sometimes problems we can't solve. So when that happens, the *right* thing to do is to find a way to share the burden of that problem equitably. 

SIS doesn't do that. All SIS does is keep people alive while we hopefully trip and stumble our way toward doing that.

&gt;I'm curious how you'd feel if a SIS was right next to your house.

Conditioned on the fact that I don't plan on living in this house for the rest of my life, I'd want money. An SIS is going to ding my property's value, and that hurts me financially. I believe I could be made whole, though. 

If I considered this my 'home' and any thought of moving somewhere else was anathema, I'd probably be a lot more upset. Ultimately, though, the powers that be don't have a lot of capacity to compensate people with anything other than money. I reject the notion that there's 'no amount of money that can make these people whole.'

Granted, this is a question of proximity. Next door or same block is one thing. Next block over is a challenge. Two blocks away, who gives a fuck. I already live within two blocks of a methadone clinic, and I hardly ever see addicts anyway. 

One way to mitigate the effect of SIS is to locate it in a high foot traffic area. Putting it in the middle of a residential block ensures that 95% of the people you pass will be associated with the SIS. Putting it on a commercial drag dilutes that substantially.

SIS is a bandage. It's to slow the bleeding. The number of overdose deaths has been increasing exponentially while not just the city, but the country as a whole is struggling to figure out the silver bullet to addiction. **I agree that we need to be spending a whole lot more resources solving that problem**. But SIS isn't meant to solve addiction. It's meant to keep people alive long enough that they find themselves a way out, or society puts together an easier path out of addiction.

The justice of war feels simple, so it's easy to campaign on. You point at the bad guy and you send planes and tanks and bombs in their direction. The justice of solving addiction is messy. You have to get down in the ditches with people who have sacrificed their own dignity to a drug. You have to watch people destroy themselves and try over and over again different ways to solve it without giving in to the temptation to see them as less-than-human.

I was at Occupy Wall Street (which... whatever) when they evicted Zucotti Park. They gave virtually no notice to the people camping there, stormed the park in the middle of the night, arrested 200 people and took and/or smashed all the campers' belongings that were left there. 

Bloomberg's statement:

&gt;From the beginning, I have said that the city has two principal goals: guaranteeing public health and safety, and guaranteeing the protesters’ First Amendment rights. But when those two goals clash, the health and safety of the public and our first responders must be the priority.”

I'm not *necessarily* advocating this approach here. And generally I tend to take a liberal approach to this issue (addiction as a public health issue rather than primarily a criminal issue, etc.)

But I'm starting to think that our city's response to the opioid epidemic is influenced significantly by goals other than public health and civil rights.

You cannot have dudes just shooting up on the sidewalk, as I’ve seen regularly, in broad daylight, and you can’t have a SIS center turn into a hub of illicit activity, which is bound to happen unless you provide overwhelming law enforcement resources, city resources, and effort to the situation COINCIDENT with such a thing.  My argument is that this will never happen, so the center shouldn’t go forward.  You’re trying to ride a horse with no saddle and she’s not broken in.  It’s ludicrous and savagely abusive to place something like this without an overall plan. So far I’ve seen nothing but whiny turds on here and elsewhere say just do it!  Well fuck that, and to hell with anyone who says otherwise.

To start with——

a mandatory treatment approach, using MAT, mainly vivitrol centered, by way of our existing drug courts and a new PA law is a solid option to deal with our situation.

Detain until drug court appearance. This is already legal, because public intoxication and/or intoxication by an illegal substance is illegal. Within 12 hours, a judge offers 1 year of treatment or 6 months of incarceration. Neither options do not go on one’s record and are expunged.  I would bet 99.9% take treatment. Subject starts treatment, gets a bed and or a call for someone who cares about them to pick them up and sign them out. A caseworker is assigned. This caseworker organizes therapy sessions, reconciliation with family, and job retraining opportunities. The subject is, in the meantime, required to report in, and continue vivitrol treatment. After one year, they’re done. If they scoot, quit, etc, it all starts over again. But with a 50% success rate, I count that as a win.

Now this must be coincident with greatly improved enforcement by the police. Open air drug markets must be shut down. K&amp;a needs to not be the place to go for heroin. A shift from picking up users to a massive increase in major crimes investigations with coordination from federal authorities to reduce supply must take place. Being publicly intoxicated to the point of nodding out like a zombie must not be tolerated. Shooting up on the street must not be tolerated. Active open air drug markets must not be tolerated. Funding needs to go to community groups and churches and former gang members and drug dealers who got out of the game and want to steer kids away from the corners. Education funding and after school programs must be improved.

Furthermore, clean needles can provide some degree of sterility to prevent acute conditions, such as soft tissue infections and infectious endocarditis, which can be a huge money sink to treat since it requires weeks of IV antibiotics and/or a heart valve replacement. 

Additionally, and what really might separate SIS from needle exchanges, it reduces costs of expensive near-mortality care if the patient overdoses and barely lives.

So SIS let you clean up the shady places currently used for shooting up, reduce harm to the users by providing clean needles and testing drugs for adulterants (ie fentanyl), and give social workers face time with users to build a rapport and help transition away from drugs when the user is ready.

The best analogy I can think of is if you have roaches, you wouldn't want to sit around near the roach traps, because then you'd see all the roaches.

It’s ludicrous and savagely abusive to place something like this without an overall plan. So far I’ve seen nothing but whiny turds on here and elsewhere say just do it!  Well fuck that, and to hell with anyone who says otherwise.

To start with——

a mandatory treatment approach, using MAT, mainly vivitrol centered, by way of our existing drug courts and a new PA law is a solid option to deal with our situation.

Detain until drug court appearance. This is already legal, because public intoxication and/or intoxication by an illegal substance is illegal. Within 12 hours, a judge offers 1 year of treatment or 6 months of incarceration. Neither options do not go on one’s record and are expunged.  I would bet 99.9% take treatment. Subject starts treatment, gets a bed and or a call for someone who cares about them to pick them up and sign them out. A caseworker is assigned. This caseworker organizes therapy sessions, reconciliation with family, and job retraining opportunities. The subject is, in the meantime, required to report in, and continue vivitrol treatment. After one year, they’re done. If they scoot, quit, etc, it all starts over again. But with a 50% success rate, I count that as a win.

Now this must be coincident with greatly improved enforcement by the police. Open air drug markets must be shut down. K&amp;a needs to not be the place to go for heroin. A shift from picking up users to a massive increase in major crimes investigations with coordination from federal authorities to reduce supply must take place. Being publicly intoxicated to the point of nodding out like a zombie must not be tolerated. Shooting up on the street must not be tolerated. Active open air drug markets must not be tolerated. Funding needs to go to community groups and churches and former gang members and drug dealers who got out of the game and want to steer kids away from the corners. Education funding and after school programs must be improved.

1069,e53kkrn,,e53g6ga,s9isu3z,dissolutewastrel,comment,shuynt,"There are many purported advantages but as I understand it the main benefits are:

* Harm reduction: The SIS are supervised by medical professionals and provide clean supplies so they will decrease deaths from overdose as well as the spread of diseases from sharing needles.
* Encouragement to attend treatment: the SIS are staffed with counselors who encourage people to attend treatment in addition to providing medical supervision. Which is probably greater than the number of people encouraging them to quit while they're out using on the streets.
* Removes drug use from the streets: likely not 100%, but it at least provides somewhere out of sight for people to use rather than breaking into abandoned properties or just nodding out in public or all over people's stoops. Which additionally would at least somewhat decrease the amount of paraphernalia and trash left out on the streets as well.

Without going into a super detailed explanation, addictive substances literally change how your brain chemistry works. When I was quitting cigs, the book I read which really helped me do it used the concept of the ""addict brain"". (Obviously the side effects of nicotine addiction aren't nearly as devastating for the individual and community as heroin, but the chemical dependence is the same.) People have moments of clarity when they are thinking without their addict brain--it's when they know and can clearly see that they want to quit and they need to quit and they need to get help to do so. But because dependence literally physically rewires your brain, that clear-headed thinking goes out the window once withdrawal occurs and the addict brain steps in. That's when you start down the path of ""well, maybe if I just cut back on how much I'm using"" or ""I'm just gonna finish this last pack and THEN I'll quit"" or ""it's hopeless, I'll never be able to quit"". Basically, your addict brain is what causes you to make all these excuses or conditions to quitting that really just serve to cover up that drive to use that is now hard-wired in your addict brain which does not want to quit.

The path to quitting is different for everyone. For me, I just got to a point where I was sick of feeling so shitty all the time from smoking, I was sick of wasting so much money on cigs, I was just fed up with it--even when I still got that ""man, smoking is great!"" feeling right after finishing a cig. For some people, they really just need to hear it enough--it really could be that they just never had someone in their life who seemed to care enough about them to encourage them to seek help. For some people, it really might be that they will never seek help until that have a brush with death...or several.

Basically, SIS are not intended to be a solution to the crisis, because there are currently far too many structural and attitudinal barriers in the way of us getting there. They are intended to reduce (note I did not say ""entirely eliminate"") the harm done to individuals and communities from addiction.

Telling people to stop doesnt work so we should at least try to find ways to mitigate their adverse effect on society.

I think its a similar parallel to abstinence only sex ed.  People are going to have sex so we should give them the tools to do so safely. Then we dont have unwanted kids who then become bigger drains on society.

Also, safe disposal of needles. I volunteer at an elementary school in Fairhill, I'd like to think those kids' parents could feel better about letting them outside.

People totally need to want to stop and I'm 100% in agreement with you. I think people are responsible for their habits and decisions but again... some are going to do it anyway.

Truth, which is why I caveated that. Opposition to SIS based on local impacts is a whole different subject, and needs to be met with two things: clarity about the improvements the proposed change will bring to locals (i.e., fewer junkies passing out on the streets/alleys/overpasses), as well as compensation for any clear losers (next door neighbors, for example). 

&gt;Since it's causing a substantial increase in homeless folks in there (as expected)

That's one of those things I take a skeptical eye to, at least until there's some evidence to back it up.

I ride the bus/subway with zombies on their way to and from Broad and Snyder.  They're not actively hurting anyone by being high.  They're literally taking up space and not bothering anyone.  When they're not high, that's when they're fucking shit up: stealing, scamming, breaking, putting their energy into getting high instead of being productive.

I also know that you can simultaneously be an addict and still lead a productive life for most of your waking hours.  It is entirely possible to be functionally opioid addicted, for certain definitions of 'functional'.  I mean having a job, paying the bills, etc., but also popping benzos to get through the day instead of shooting up.

Your solution involves a TON of resources.  Let's be clear: a ton of resources are absolutely necessary to even come close to solving the problem.

I believe, like many things that have opposing forces, the city/country had reached an equilibrium when it comes to controlling people's opioid consumption, but recent events have tipped that equilibrium beyond the city's control.

There are solutions.  Diffusing the supply market is a solution, but not if you expect overall, long-term net-good outcomes.  Neither is a crackdown.  There needs to be a comprehensive top-to-bottom plan implemented AND enforced.  It needs to not be subject to political or economic whims in order to succeed.

Mandatory treatment with vivitrol should be implemented, with a support structure and plenty of caseworkers and personnel to provide therapy, help reconnect with family, get job assistance, and even a stipend and temp housing when possible. 1 year. No criminal charges, no record, no expungement needed.  Kensington should not be a destination for addicts from all over the east coast.  The people of c and Indiana would thank you.

Bottom line is just throwing out SIS as the way is not smart in Philadelphia’s unique situation. 

Cost? Who cares. Float a bond, fix the problem, and watch the city bloom. There are so many people, working people, with kids, that just wanna live their lives. We shouldn’t ignore that, and pat ourselves on the back for proposing SIS. ",1517091457,6,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,27-01-2018,14:17:37,,,,False,7teotd,1

* Compensation should primarily be based on the depreciation the site causes to surrounding buildings, and should be evaluated in the 2-3 years after the site kicks off to recalibrate assumptions

* Residential properties should be considered more vulnerable than commercial/industrial properties

* Owner-occupied properties should be considered more vulnerable than rental units

Reason behind it is that (and I've never done heroin so ya know, I don't actually know) the effects are almost immediate and would involve moving or corraling that person into the common area... to be strung out with a bunch of other users.  That time may have included what was necessary to sanatize everything down and get the fresh supplies out. I don't recall, exactly. Loitering inside these places is a major issue.

As far as the repeat user, most sites have a 1/day limit to prevent both loitering and overruse. Allowing multiple uses per day only cuts down on the number of actual people served. 

More regulations that had to be implemented were things like, no non-residents of the city (Zurich), no loitering in the common area, only coming on prescribed times, closing the store during periods of the day, locking everyone in after a short window of being open, to try and control the group coming in. I agree with the non-residency laws, and actually wish Philly would move heavily hand out city-limit bans to non-residents convicted of purchase/distribution here. Make other towns pay for their own residents, ala what we did to that chick who helped attack the gay couple.

Non-profits that operate like that are being funded primarily through government grants as opposed to private funds. It would still need heavy government oversight to make sure funds are being used properly. Also, you then have competing non-profits, and if people aren't already thrilled with charter schools in Philly, why expand that privilege to SIS centers. I could also go on a huge rant (for another thread) about how Philly has way too many non-profits (coming from someone in non-profit) and it leads to a ton of waste and inefficiency in how we pay these groups for services. Non-profits are VERY limited in Europe and Canada, especially legal services where you may only have a handful for certain categories of matters.

And I don't believe they improve the safety of the neighborhood, and for a city like Philly that has a poverty level not experienced in Sydney, Vancouver, or Zurich, where these centers are to be located would likely not be where people would have otherwised move to. It's only continuing to draw drug tourists to those hot spots.

I'm not in favor of a ""police sanctioned Hamsterdam"" of sorts, even where it's just monitoring ""safe use"" on the streets and arrest anyone trying to drive. Something similar was tried in Switzerland in the 90s (Platz Park) and resulted in a relative disaster for the city, not so unlike McPherson. 

Philly is already stepping on quite a few toes with its blatantly illegal decriminalization of marijuana, we don't need to keep pushing it by having police disregard other state and federal crimes.

1291,dkji3mw,,dkj8355,,,comment,rubiredd,"Some of those figures seem overly generous to me.  Why allow 30 minutes in an injection booth for instance?  10 minutes should suffice.  Then you could have a common area type of space, monitored by a security guard to prevent theft or dealing, where people could stay as long as they wanted to nod out.  Also, keep in mind that many of the ""clients"" would be repeat users coming back throughout the day, who would otherwise be hanging around the neighborhood anyway, because it's also where they buy their dope and they don't have anything else to do.  So instead of shooting up on someone's doorstep or an abando, they do it in the SIS.  Others would be the heroin tourists who come to Philly to buy, currently shoot up in their cars because they're dope sick and can't wait, then drive off for fear of cops, and sometimes nod out and run over people.  They'd be there once a day at most, most would stick around and nod out for a while, and cops could easily monitor the area around the site and arrest anyone who tries to drive while visibly intoxicated.  A lot of the addict population wouldn't use them at all, if they have the wherewithal to go home before they get high, and that's fine.

Finally, I don't think the city should actually run these sites.  I think they should allow non-profit groups to run them, similar to how they do for needle exchanges.  There are a lot of churches and other non profits that already have facilities of various sorts, and they could choose to make an SIS if the city allowed it and laid down some basic ground rules for safety.  I agree that the city running it would not be cost effective or particularly desirable.

My calculation at 10 booths puts you at 0.38%; and that's a moderate size building the size of maybe 1000sqft. floor space? Figure 10sq. ft./person, 25% to administrative, 30% to waiting room, and that leaves you with about 12 booths at 36sqft. a booth (that's 3ft. x 6ft. personal space for each person). 

That's 12 people/30mins. not accounting for just continued loitering inside and outside the facility (all of which are reported in other studies of similar facilities). 

Fine.... scale it up, make it bigger. 24000sq.ft. property (4258 Frankford Ave.) is $1mil. and is an empty shell warehouse. Plan on another $1.5m minimum to bring it up to code and be useful +insurance, +security, +staffing, +technology, etc. and I (based on my spitballing in between work estimates) would put you at $5m before day one.

24000sq.ft. using my other figures puts you at 300 persons/half-hour (4800 per day at 8hrs.) and that's non-stop. At that rate, you've now served 9.6% of the est. heroin user population. That's pretty commendable - if not for two problems 1) you've created a large-scale drug using factory that has more turnover than any other facility; 2) you've created not just a **massive** influx of persons to 4200 block of Frankford, but now a major criminal situation for anyone living nearby because what dealer wouldn't just want to go to a pool of 4800 potential buyers? Youv'e also now entirely severed any chance of a neighborhood, easily accessible to the El and 95, from seeing the same growth that similar nearby neighborhoods have seen.

Alright, alright I get it. /r/mctrumpshake you can just fuck right off because I'm obviously not talking about a scale that big and you're being  shallow and pendantic. 

Scale it down to 4k and you serve 800 persons/day (1.6%)
Scale it up to 8k and you serve 1600 person/day (3.2%)
Scale it down to 2k and you serve 400 persons/day (0.8%)

To put that in perspective; the 

By going the route of **large scale facility** you absolutely put **all the harm** on incredibly cheap, already exploited neighborhoods. Not even just Kensington. I'd in fact tell you that real estate ain't all that cheap there for commercial/industrial properties, and it's only going to continue to grow in the next few years. It's too convenient to the El and I-95 otherwise.  To put a place like this in Rittenhouse it would cost about $8m for the building alone (I'm thinking residential); Old City maybe $6m? That's Day One Expenses, and you know the wealthier neighborhoods will suceed in keeping a large scale facility out. People can cry NIMBY, but when you're serving 3% of a group, for an expected return of 2 less fatalities at the expense of a booming influx of drug users that need to be crowd-controlled, queued, and shoo'd away for loitering. 

For **smaller sites** you go back to my original problem. Imagine how much a 4k sq.ft. building costs in any part of this city. That knocks out anywhere remotely with a better-then-poor population (again neighborhood discrimination). Small sites in other countries serve about 100-350 persons a day. I don't know of any large scale sites that I've looked into that greater go above that. To even target 5% of the heroin user population, you would need 9 facilities serving 300 clients a day. Now you're talking about a central HQ operation to run those programs, and staff numbers rivaling medium healthcare practices. This would be fine... if SIS was proven to be incredibly beneficial. Which, going back, it's not. You don't decrease heroin use with SIS. You at best stagnate health risks with a minor decrease for HIV. You reduce ODs by 9 fatalities a year (gross estimate based on Canada's 1.08 site/year) , which is a reduction of only 1% of Philly's overall OD fatality population.

**This long-winded bullshit hasn't even factored in the following.** Demand for these neighborhoods is expected to continue growing. 8 hours a day at 2 per half-hour doesn't even cover **cleaning and sanitizing** the facility, nor does it cover record-keeping, administrative costs,  security, police presence, full-time EMS staff, trained first response, transit costs, vagrancy costs.

What's my point?

Or they'll just go back to the SIS to shoot up again later?  Great, let them, that's what it's there for.  What you don't seem to understand is that certain parts of Kensington are already a hub of foot traffic for addicts, because they are going there to cop dope multiple times a day.  If the SIS is right nearby, it's not going to increase the number of junkies, it'll just concentrate them in one place, where it's easier to watch for DUI's and other safety issues.

1298,dkixy8x,,dkiv60g,101vbj,WheresRet,comment,McTrumpShake,"I can answer this, and also clear up for those people who don't actually know what an SIS center is.

Picture it like a recording studio, medium size building, your average neighborhood bar.  The interior actually varies but there's a few commonalities overall. When you first walk in, it's like any other health clinic or doctor's office. You check-in with the desk, join the queue and wait for your turn.

Some will have seats that face along the wall with a table, and a mirror or aluminum panel (reflective) with partitions on the sides for privacy. Picture a bank but instead of facing glass and another person, you're just facing the wall.

Others will have actual individual rooms (size varies) that accommodate either a small group or one at a time. Inside those rooms, it's again very sterile and clean, all stainless steel (easily cleanup) with tables. On the tables will be supplies common for heroin use, cups, spoons, candles, lighters, gauze, tie-offs, etc.

All good stuff... except there's a logistical issue here that makes these centers AT BEST relateively ineffective in making headway against not just decreasing use (which they aren't designed for) but even for health and safety.

When you go into a hospital, you sit in a waiting room because there's a limited number of patient rooms. Similarly, SIS's also inevitably have you wait. Check-in can involve signing in (typical), showing an ID card (not typical, people lose them), getting in a queue line (usual, but discouraged because people cut and/or leave the line) OR (the best solution) you get a number like you would at a grocer deli. When your number is called, you go up to the booth/seat/room and get your fix.

THE INHERENT PROBLEM. **YOU CANNOT SERVE ENOUGH CLIENTS WITH ONE CENTER** Users are given some time for injection and then the initial high to sit in the room. Typically, about 30 minutes. Most users hang out in the centers after they've inject, because they're high. If you have 10 booths (high estimate) at 30mins/piece at an 8hr. shift that's **only 160 injections.** Most centers limit the center to once/day, some only a few times a week. You know a heroin user? It's a not a once/day type habit. Furthermore, the people primarily using these centers (with the exception of the Zurich center, I believe) are those addicts hooked for 15+ years. The population with the least likelihood of every fulling recovering or reintergrating into mainstream society. There is an excellent documentary (Netflix? Youtube?) about Switzerland's ""heroin-handout program"" which distributes ""safe"" doses for free to the most at-risk users (long-term, no other program has worked, not likely to quit) so that they spend the rest of their day, as best as they can,  being productive. It *relatively* works, and from my recollection, it reduces incidence of crime for those recipients (which number less than 100) BUT there is an interview with a guy on the program who did manage to get a part-time role as a line-cook who said something to the effect of while he was grateful for the program, on the other hand it really was a punch to the gut in that it felt as if Switzerland's people had abandoned him and said he wasn't worthy of getting better, so here's some heroin and stay in the shadows. And after a few years on the program, while he's a line cook and that's great... there's no hope of transitioning off heroin at that point and he felt like he was deemed a ""lost cause.""  Something to greatly consider before simply pushing for ""gov. condoned heroin use""

Eval. reports on SIS's put the percentage of users who will *inject the same day on the street* between 85%-95%. For a city like Phialdelphia, where the estimated number of users is about 50,000... you have served in a day, only **160 of those persons**  That is only **0.32%** of the heroin user population being served. And most of them are *still going to use on the street.* There's not much data either way about direct correlation with reduction in used needles on the street, used drug vials (although I will say in Australia there's some downward trend, possibly attributed to a heroin dought) AND there isn't much of a shift in HIV prevalance (decreasing anyways because users are learning) AND there's even been some upwards trend of HepB (or maybe HepC I forget).

Alright, well these SIS centers also serve other functions. Particularly, a *needle exchange,* *literature*, and *treatment advice.*  First, Philadelphia already has needle exchanges and I am 100% in support of them. I don't love walk-in centers, but I do support walk-around distributors who are registered and trained. As far as literature distribution, the reason I'm so heavily involved (despite my opposition) is because I was helping run a resource program for people being evicted or facing other civil issues. Drug use played into 3/4ths of my caseload. We distribute literature already, we have *a megafuckton* of non-profits that already do the standard ""Here's where you can go, let's make a call, here's the health risks, here's who to talk to if your facing trial, etc."" In fact **Philly's Court of Common Pleas has its own ""help-center"" for these types of issues.** (and I thought the gov. wasn't doing anything) and will get you connected with legal advocates, health representatives, diversion programs, mortgage foreclosure avoidance, vetrans benefits, etc.

What about *reducing ODs?* Jury is still up in the air. Most stats actually show a relative *higher* incidence of OD in these centers, BUT to be fair - since the population attending are generally heavier users that's to be expected over the general population. Everyone who works there is trained to handle ODs, with some centers administering only CPR while others use Narcan or similar devices. It is **incredibly taxing work** for persons who work in these centers, and they will often rotate staff out because you're seeing the worst of huamnity day-in. Staff PTSD isn't uncommon. There was a 1996 report back from a Swiss eval. that talked about only trying to hire *smokers* at these cafes, simply because smokers seemed more tolerant to the health crises the centers frequently experience. 

That said --- *statistically YES deaths from ODs are lower than general population because of monitoring.* However, that benefit is to the tune of an estimated **1 save/year**, and stats are loose at best because it's hard to quantify OD deaths since records weren't well-kept until more recently.

What we don't invest enough in is **well funded treatment centers** that allow for rehab in a safe/clean/stable environment for those that WANT help BUT aren't qualified through public benefits or private pay.** Better yet is, these programs can be opened *well away from the general public,* and that may sound fucked up - but it's a better alternative to the shanty treatment centers that we open right next to where the person was copping a week ago.

tl;dr: SIS's are a great novel idea... but logistically they don't serve enough people to be worthwhile as an effective long-term solution because they inherently only serve a very small handful of the population.



Source? I'm on mobile (typing on a keyboard) with slow-ass internet service. I'm typing this from my recollection of research that I've done over the past few years about these centers and other similar treatment options. Some were reports on Switzerland, Australia, Germany, and Canada's centers, particularily looking at what the Swiss have tried (they fuckin' love experiments). I've actually been the Vancouver InSite and would be happy to talk all about how that wouldn't implement really well in Kensington. Teachers will tell you all about the **NEW IMPROVED PROGRAM** that comes out every five years, which will be replaced soon enough because turns out the research to support implementation and alleged success just wasn't properly conducted and the government *bought in* based on faulty data.

I would be in favor of this, although I'm not sure how it would work in practice.  I suspect most of the time it wouldn't be necessary though.  I have way more experience than I could wish for with this, and most heroin addicts who've just shot up don't have much motivation to do *anything* for a while.  They just want to sit and enjoy their high, especially if they're somewhere safe where they're not worried about getting stopped by cops or robbed or whatever.  You could easily park a couple of cops outside to watch people leaving, and if anyone who's impaired gets behind the wheel, then they're gonna get pulled over and arrested.  It would actually make it much easier to police for, if all the traffic was coming from one location.  So it would be a carrot and stick approach, where they have a spot to shoot up and be high, but also much higher chance of going to jail if they drove under the influence.  I think a lot of people who live in the neighborhood could get on board with something like that.",1500650592,1,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,21-07-2017,08:23:12,,,,False,6olws4,1

... Also, we're talking SIS, not needle exchange programs, which Philadelphia already has. And thats not even getting into the major logistical issue. These centers are usually able to accommodate about 100-300 person's a day at a rate of 1 injection/user. 95% of those visitors will use again on the street, most the same day. Philly has a heroin users addict population of about 50,000 active users (est. 2.8%). Evals of Canada and Australia are all over the place, but from the studies I've read, most centers report higher ODs then gen. population. Thats possibly due to more serious users being the primary visitors. Others report no noticable change in health. By Germany's report, out of 500,000 injections, these centers save about 5 OD fatalities that would have otherwise occurred. Canada estimates the programs save about 1.08/person's year. Crime evals are all self-interest but range from no increase, wide  public support, to requiring immediate police presence, business petition, and honeypotting in nearby alleys  and behind the centers. Cost-wise, centers are about $500k-$1m to run. At best, SISs do little to make an appreciable dent in the community and for the benefit of heroin users. We have better solution like methadone and actual treatment programs.

Anyway, we pulled into this Barnaby's after a rare day out together shopping. This bar is next to our parents house and we teased ""partying in delco"" -- before that night, I had never got drunk with my big sister. She relaxed in front of me for the first time ever (totally serious- 36 years and shes always the big sis- serious, distant etc)--That night we drank together , we did shots together, played air hockey with locals, sang to songs we both knew, and charmed the shit outta the regulars around us- buying drinks and having a genuinely great time. 

I wanted to buy her a Barnaby's mug or shirt or whatever this Christmas just to commemorate that lone, epic night when we got to be friends. 

I had to move out of the area for my husbands work. I've only been gone for about a year. She was diagnosed with Stage 4 stomach and liver cancer right before we moved away.

I work 3 jobs and travel via pubic transportation and take care of my baby sis who will be attending a new school this September via pubic transportation. I also take care of my baby bro whose 5 and starting Kindergarten. So along with back to school costs and the general things they need, to offset transportation would be amazing. I appreciate your offer nonetheless and thanks for reading, OP.:)",1408394988,2,,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,18-08-2014,13:49:48,,,,,2dvnky,1

I do various table-top RPGs (not so bar friendly, tho) as well as Cards Against Humanity, Axis &amp; Allies, Catan, most other board games. Feel free to PM me if you want to get folks together, I'm probably down any night of the week. Some people I recently met play Warmachine, and I'm thinking of introducing them to Pathfinder.

Game on sis :)",1381092030,1,,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,06-10-2013,13:40:30,,,,,1nri7z,1

I want to tell you Lansdale is okay, and that theres still bars and people. But its not. There are some decent people, you can get cheap drinks but it is not better or comparable to a youth spent in Philly. Do what you can to get out of it. If you can't get out, we can hang out. At least until I move back to Philly in 2 months =)
